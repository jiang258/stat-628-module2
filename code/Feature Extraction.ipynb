       "'Total bill for this horrible service? Over $8Gs. These crooks actually had the nerve to charge us $69 for 3 pills. I checked online the pills can be had for 19 cents EACH! Avoid Hospital ERs at all costs.Today was my second out of three sessions I had paid for. Although my first session went well, I could tell Meredith had a particular enjoyment for her male clients over her female. However, I returned because she did my teeth fine and I was pleased with the results. When I went in today, I was in the whitening room with three other gentlemen. My appointment started out well, although, being a person who is in the service industry, I always attend to my female clientele first when a couple arrives. Unbothered by those signs, I waited my turn. She checked on me once after my original 30 minute timer to ask if I was ok. She attended my boyfriend on numerous occasions, as well as the other men, and would exit the room without even asking me or looking to see if I had any irritation. Half way through, another woman had showed up who she was explaining the deals to in the lobby. While she admits timers must be reset half way through the process, she reset my boyfriends, left, rest the gentleman furthest away from me who had time to come in, redeem his deal, get set, and gave his timer done, before me, then left, and at this point my time was at 10 minutes. So, she should have reset it 5 minutes ago, according to her. While I sat there patiently this whole time with major pain in my gums, i watched the time until the lamp shut off. Not only had she reset two others, explained deals to other guest, but she never once checked on my time. When my light turned off, I released the stance of my mouth to a more relaxed state, assuming I was only getting a thirty minute session instead of the usual 45, because she had yet to come in. At this point, the teeth formula was not only burning the gum she neglected for 25 minutes now, but it began to burn my lips. I began squealing and slapping my chair trying to get her attention from the other room in a panic. I was in so much pain, that by the time she entered the room I was already out of my chair. She finally then acknowledged me, and asked if she could put vitamin E on my gum burn (pictured below). At this point, she has treated two other gums burns, while neglecting me, and I was so irritated that I had to suffer, all I wanted was to leave. While I waited for my boyfriend, she kept harassing me about the issue. Saying, \"well burns come with teeth whitening.\" While I totally agree, and under justifiable circumstances would not be as irritate, it could have easily been avoid if she had checked on me even a second time, so I could let her know. Not only did she never check on my physical health, she couldn\\'t even take two seconds to reset the timer, which she even admitted to me. Her accuse was that she was coming in to do it, but I had the light off for a solid two minutes before I couldn\\'t stand the pain. She admitted it should be reset every 15 minutes, which means for 25 minutes she did not bother to help me at all. Her guest in the lobby then proceeded to attack me as well, simply because I wanted to leave after the way I was treated. I also expected a refund for not getting a complete session today, due to the neglect, and the fact I won\\'t be returning for my last, she had failed to do that. She was even screaming from the door, and continued to until my boyfriend and I were down the steps. I have never in my life been more appalled by a grown woman\\'s behavior, who claims to be in the business for \"10 years.\" Admit your wrongs, but don\\'t make your guest feel unwelcome because you can\\'t do you job properly.This place has gone down hill.  Clearly they have cut back on staff and food quality\\n\\nMany of the reviews were written before the menu changed.  I\\'ve been going for years and the food quality has gone down hill.\\n\\nThe service is slow & my salad, which was $15, was as bad as it gets.\\n\\nIt\\'s just not worth spending the money on this place when there are so many other options.Walked in around 4 on a Friday afternoon, we sat at a table just off the bar and walked out after 5 min or so. Don\\'t even think they realized we walked in. However everyone at the bar noticed we walked in!!! Service was non existent at best. Not a good way for a new business to start out. Oh well, the location they are at has been about 5 different things over the past several years, so they will just be added to the list. SMDH!!!I cannot believe how things have changed in 3 years. I picked up duck congee sometime in the winter when my hubby was sick.  I was very disappointed because the ginger fish sauce tasted like it had gone bad (it should never be bitter).  Today, my hubby wanted to eat there since he was craving the duck congee and most places don\\'t serve the duck & coleslaw side. We waited about 10 minutes to get our menu.  After we placed our orders, we waited another 5 minutes to get the tea that most places bring with the menu.  I could go on with the details but the gist of the story is they were understaffed or the staff was slow.  The worst part of it was that the service.  The servers make us feel bad for asking for anything (like when they took our order).  We had arrived and placed our order before another couple bside us at least 10 minutes ahead but somehow, this couple received their pho before mine.  They were almost done eating their pho before mine came out.Unfortunately, I must recommend not to conduct any business with Fast Fix Jewelry and Watch Repairs.  The staff is completely unprofessional and I have never been treated so rudely in my life.  I was actually shocked and walked away thinking \"wow, how do those people even have a job?\"\\n\\nI have never written a negative review before, I usually chalk it up to someone having a bad day.  I have worked in customer service for 10+ years and I know it is exhausting and bad days happen.  But this is a special occasion.\\n\\nI drove 30 minutes to try to find someone who could help me repair a watch band.  I was barely greeted upon arrival and right away felt like I was bothering them.  The girl behind the counter obviously just wanted me to leave, the blond kid working snapped at me when I asked a question and when I re-asked in order to clarify what he said he snapped again and said, \"I already told you?!?\"  \"Is this even authentic?\"  Shouting at me over his shoulder as he work on something else. \\n\\nI was shocked and just stood there put my watch away awkwardly and left with no one else saying a word to me.  There are a lot of places that fix Jewelry in this city and I will be taking my business elsewhere and recommend that people reading this review do the same.  Some places, just do not deserve a loyal customer base.if i can give this place no stars i would, i only had their hot pot though, so im not a good judge for anything besides their shabu. i must say, quantity was small, price is expensive for the quality and quantity, and the taste of the soup base is bland as if they just put hot water in. the sauce selection is limited and not very fresh/clean from my perspective. i love hot pot and i would never go back again because home made hot pot can be much better than this place without even trying. anyways, if you have a good appetite for hot pot, you can do yourself a favor and skip this place because it can make you miserable!This review is in regards to our experience watching SuperBowl 51 February 5, 2017 at the WestGate in the theater/auditorium.\\n\\nWatch the game somewhere else.....\\n\\nTo those unfamiliar with The Big Game experience at WestGate you typically would get in line to watch the Superbowl in the theater portion of the hotel around 8 am on Superbowl Sunday. This line can get extremely long yet the earlier you get in line your choice of seating significantly improves.So...after waiting in line for a few hours we were notified the lower portion of the theater was reserved for paid customers who previously purchased wristbands for $100 (including alcohol and hot dogs) and instead we would be seated in the balcony portion of the theater.No problem, something different, we said. Mistake.\\n\\nSo at 1:30 pm we were sent upstairs to the balcony to take our seats and prepare to watch the big game at 3:30. Once we take our seats one of us ( we\\'re in a group of 8 ) will hold the seats while the rest of us will go out to the casino floor and gamble or go the the sports book and place a couple last minute bets.Please note the patrons that leave the auditorium will receive a hand stamp or wristband to allow reentry to the theater. BUT INSTEAD....\\n\\nWe were told by Westgate staff that no hand stamps or wristbands would be given and we were ON OUR OWN if we choose to leave and we would not be allowed back in. Wow.\\nThat\\'s right, after waiting in line all morning if we wanted to go downstairs to play blackjack, place a bet at the book, or maybe have a bite to eat because no food was made available upstairs we would be out of luck. Nice work Westgate.\\n\\nSo we were seated upstairs...stuck. With no food or soda available for purchase. Only beer and water was sold in the balcony food counter. That was at 1:45 p.m. After vigorously complaining to Westgate staff ( to ushers with yellow jackets and security with black jackets ) at 3:04 pm wristbands were given out. At 3:18 hot dogs and soda were made available for sale in the balcony. I believe this was a direct result of all the upset patrons like myself that were seated in the balcony level.\\n\\nIn summary, for being the biggest sportbook in Las Vegas this place is dysfunction and fails to satisfy the most basic request to provide food and comfort to betting patrons. A total mess. This place sucks. Watch the big game and bet your money some where else. We will.I tried this place because my girls are away for a month, and I REALLY wanted to try to wait until they came back, because NOBODY can hold a candle to them, but my toes were desperate.  When I went in, they were almost twice what I usually pay to begin with.  Then, before starting the pedicure, I specifically told them I already had gel polish on my toes.  They didn\\'t tell me right then and there \"that will be an extra $5\\'.  No, they waited until it was time to pay, and not only charged me for that, but they charged me all kinds of extra fees that I didn\\'t even ask for!  I had also informed the girl that my toenail was loose and needed gluing.  While I was looking at my phone, all of a sudden I felt this sensation, and she RIPPED OFF MY TOENAIL!!!!  Without even asking me!!!!!!  So then she had another girl come and put acrylic on there since the nail underneath was only 1/2 grown.  Again, they didn\\'t tell me how much this would be, or even ask my permission, they just charged me at the end.  \\n\\nThe added stone \\'massage\\' was barely a massage!  She rubbed the stones up my lower legs a couple times, and that was it.  It lasted about 30 seconds.   And when I asked for a design, I\\'m used to getting a board with a bunch of designs to choose from.  She didn\\'t even ask me what I wanted, she just painted a few lines on my two toes and then charge me 5 MORE dollars for that! \\n\\nUgh, I don\\'t care HOW ugly my toes look next time, I will NEVER go anywhere else besides Bella Nails again, they ROCK!!!!!!!  This place was appalling.  I didn\\'t want to make a scene, so I just paid the money, but I will NEVER go back!!!!!!!Love this place downtown but the Scottsdale location has no manners. Sat at bar for 10 min while bartender ignored us. No menu, no water. We walked out and they could have cared less.They keep there appointments on time and are pretty efficient. However I am very disappointed in how they think that just because I am a girl that I do not know what is going on with my car\\'s tires. The guy that helped me out told me that my two front tires tread was extremely low and that I would be needing two new tires in a month or two. He told me that he could show me the same tires I have on there now and how much they would be. When the I had taken my car to the other Discount Tire they told me it that my tread was actually still really good for how many miles I have on my car. When he told me the price of the two tires it was around $280. Which I had just bought two new ones a couple months before that and they were the same price. So when I bought the two new tires my tire pressure light came on not that long after that. I honestly feel like the tires were not even new and did not look worth $280.Met a friend for dinner there tonight. The server only brought us one menu. After she brought us a couple of Cokes she didn\\'t come to our table for 20 mins. After trying to get her attention a few times when she walked by we decided to just order off the bartender. We received the starters and the mains at the same time. The wings, brisket, and mac and cheese were alright at best. At this point we hadn\\'t seen the server since she brought the food, so we had to go to the bar for more napkins and refills on the Cokes. The most we actually saw our server was when she hovered over us as we put the tip into the handheld credit card terminal. \\n\\nFood was somewhere between okay and decent. Service was somewhere between piss poor and terrible.We had dinner at the Bellagio Buffet last night. The service was OK. Our server was great but kind of forgot about us towards the end of our visit. The food was cold. The only good thing there was the crab legs because they\\'re suppose to be cold and the tacos because it was freshly made. The food was under a single lamp that didn\\'t heat the food at all. We let the server know that the food was cold and he told the manager that was in charge. All she did was come over to ask what the problem was and said she was going to talk to the chief. Have no idea what actually happened though because we didn\\'t see her after that. Half the buffet was closed as well so there wasn\\'t that many options. I must say i rather go to the Rio buffet. For a high end casino this was a horrible experience.I am years out from surgery with sacs and I wish I could turn back time.  He promises great things them butchers your body. I should have left my body alone. It was not bAd. I was out to perfect it.  We often talk about how he ruined a good body.  I will never forget his dirty nasty slippers coming into the operating room. I should have run from the room then.I\\'ve never experienced discrimination as I did last night at this place. I was with 2 other females...we had on dresses and heels. The place was very diverse as far as how everyone was dressed. Dresses, heels, jeans, flip flops, shorts, etc. Immediately we noticed large groups of people of a particular race coming from the back of the line and going inside. We thought nothing of it...assumed they were all on lists. Then it just got weird. We noticed the guy working the door was walking back and fourth scanning the line for people he would pull out and let go inside. Every time it just happened to be groups with Caucasian people. 4 Caucasian girls were in front of us and behind a group of 4 black males. The girls were pulled out of the line and taken to the door to go inside, no talk of any lists. The guys were told they must be on a list or leave. The guys left. We watched this happen quite a few more times before we just gave up here and removed ourselves from the line. We were standing in the front for a really long time with no acknowledgement from the guy working the door. Funny thing is he didn\\'t make a big announcement that we must be on a list to get inside. He was walking up to particular groups and telling them in a low tone so they would leave. I know it wasn\\'t because of how we were dressed or looked....they were letting people in with jeans and flip flops. Ultimately we were let in by a bouncer at a side door. There was nothing so special going on in there that they had to be \"picky\" about who they let inside. It was like a night at Suite.  Safe to say, I will never step foot in this place again.((( LADIES BEWARE))) Don\\'t ever take your machine to 35th Ave. sew and vac on Northern they broke my Elna machine while it was being repaired. I\\'ve spent over $10.000 at their store over the years and have been a long time customer .. Bill the owners son was so rude to me and did nothing to resolve my broken machine. I was disgusted when Bill the owners daughter wouldn\\'t do Any thing to help me when the repair man broke my machine. It\\'s terrible to bring a nice sewing machine in to be repaired and these people broke it while in their possession and they don\\'t want to do a damm thing about it. It was like a big (screw you) to me. I won\\'t buy another thing from these people for the way I was treated. Even the material is too over priced. I\\'m in the market for another machine but I won\\'t go there ever again. My machine STILL NEEDS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF AND THEY STILL HAVE NOT RESOLVED THIS ISSUE. ITS STILL BROKEN AND IT HAPPENED WHILE REPAIRMAN WAS SERVICING MY MACHINE. I WISH I HAD NEVER TAKEN MY MACHINE TO 35TH AVE SEW AND VAC SHOP. WHY CANT PEOPLE OWN UP TO TAKE OWNERSHIP TO THEIR RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN MISTAKES!!!! GO TO KINGS SEWING MACHINES MUCH BETTER SERVICE AND THEY DONT BREAK YOUR MACHINE!!!!!Th service here is very hit or miss... Sometimes the staff is personable and attentive. Other times I ask myself, \"Why do I come here???\" The staff often has the  \"GTFOH\" stamp placed permanently across their foreheads, and we as patrons just have to go with it, otherwise we are deemed \"that guy.\"  I would say that my continuos visits were for the great HH, but there are several other options close to home, with the same food and drink options for me to choose from. I think today may be last visit...At least the Pinks concession stand by Section 3.  Unqualified servers who don\\'t tell you that they won\\'t take cash - and they seriously won\\'t take cash.  Then the manager wouldn\\'t even take the cash to another register. The lines are stupid \\nlong and the workers incapable of handling the slightest issue. I m sitting upstairs if there is a next time I come to a Knights game.I was told so many great things about this place but my entire experience was awful. The food wasn\\'t very good, way too greasy. My fries were luke warm and my tray was literally covered in grease. I needed about 50 napkins and a shower after that. The service was pretty awful too. I can\\'t believe I paid $14 for a small meal with no extra fixings. On national cheeseburger day of all days too. Such a disappointment and I\\'ve never gone back since. Best thing about it was the soda, but that\\'s pretty difficult to mess up.Came here for the \"midnight\" launch of the PSVR. After previously being told by another employee a week prior to get there at 6:01PM to get one of the six extra systems that weren\\'t pre-ordered, and that it was first come first serve, I ended up not able to get a system. When I came in yesterday, the woman behind the counter told me they had written down names and numbers of people who wanted one a few days prior, and that they all were accounted for. \\n\\nThe previous employee even told me I was the first person to have asked about it. If they were organized, and told ALL their employees customers could put their names down on a PSVR, I could have gotten a system last night.\\n\\nNot only did this illiminate my chances of getting a system at GameStop, but made it too late for me to go to other department stores who had stock (as they were too far away, and lines were already forming at each location). \\n\\nNot happy.They charged me twice what I expected to pay. The guy at the counter small-talked me, asked me if I wanted \"any additional insurance\" - I said no - and just initialed where he told me to, not noticing that one thing I initialed was collision waiver insurance, which I did not need and ended up doubling the original cost. He did not walk me through the additional cost and may even have been purposely misleading by distracting me with small talk. I am an experienced traveler and nothing like this has happened to me before. When I returned the car and expressed my surprise at the doubled cost they essentially said \"well you signed it\" and \"it\\'s worth it anyway.\" I will never rent from this Payless again.Awful place. Staff is not nice, very rude.  They never seem to want to help at all..Their service is not up to par & always out of bagelsI have no idea what the owner\\'s problem is, but he\\'s incredibly rude. His wife, on the other hand is super nice (an odd mix).\\n\\nGreat space, rude owner and the coffee is average.Ok so I have purchased items from RC Wiley and have spent a lot of money but will never again. I had a $500 credit limit after I purchased my fridge and when  iwent to use it towards ny bed room purchase it was no longer available due to me paying it off too soon????? (Apparently since I paid $500 in 2months instead of $25 in 10 months) When we attempted to question what they meant and if there was anything that couldbe done the supervisor emele pretty much told us to take a flying leap -are you serious!!  So I spent my $2300 at Ashley furniture. RC Wiley apparently is balling and they don\\'t need me to buy anything. Good luck! when u have poor customer service reps representing you like that their making your company look bad.Let me start by saying that I love Aveda which is why I decided to try this salon... and it was a big mistake. I explained what I wanted to the stylist, and even showed two photos. It\\'s easy to get this cut wrong since it\\'s short hair, so I also showed a photo of what exactly I DID NOT want. She asked what I didn\\'t like about the photo and I explained it (it\\'s a section in the back and she acted like she understood). The cut finishes, she spins me around and it is literally EXACTLY what I showed her that I didn\\'t want. I was mortified and now trying to grow this hideous cut out. Nothing is blended and she butchered my hair. And to make matters worse, she wasn\\'t even friendly! Heading to a different salon today to try and get it fixed.Place took forever... Come to find out that they didn\\'t have my oil filter and a hour and a half into me waiting the Napa parts guy pulls up and 10 mins later it was done... Hmmm.. But they didn\\'t even let me know what was going on! Never going backI just had a terrible experience with Dr. Jennifer Vonya-Novak\\'s front office.  I changed my primary care to Dr. Novak.  It took me 3 weeks to get an appointment because she ONLY DOES 4 NEW PATIENTS A DAY.  I waited the 3 weeks for what I was told was a 7:45 am appt.  I got to her office at 7:45 (actually 7:47 am according to my cell phone).  The door was locked and the office hours posted were 8:00- to 5:00.  I could see through the glass doors that there wasn\\'t anyone at the desk area.  l left ,went home and called a 8 am, no answer.  Called again at 8:10 and the lady said I missed my appointment and could not be seen today.  She argued that the door is always open at 7:45.  She was unapologetic and offered me a next day appointment, like she was doing me a favor since I \"MISSED\" my appointment.  She kept calling me \"my dear\" as if I was incapable of knowing the appointment time.  I found her very condescending.  Needless to say, I will not be going to Dr. Novak and will let my friends know the office procedures there and the unbendable and arrogant rules!Was very excited for happy hour and heard great things. Food was less then average we were charged $10 for BREAD.  Most apps were greasy or fried and still spent $250 on happy hour menu for a group of 4. First review on yelp so cared enough to take the time to write this. Sorry won\\'t come back.PLEASE. Read this before you buy a session with her. About a year ago I bought a groupon here and having a horrible experience I\\'ve never used groupon for services again.\\n\\nYou get what you pay for - and in this case, less. Lesson learned.\\n\\nShe uses clumps of lashes that fall off within 12 hours. Your eyes will also be completely bloodshot from whatever glue she uses. I let her know and even sent pictures of my eyes because they were so red and painful I thought they were infected. She blamed it on me and offered to \"fix\" them for more money. I declined - there was no way I was letting her do any more damage. I have had my lashes done before and since with professionals and have never had that happen. I love the lash service at wishful winking and the spot in Liberty village. \\n\\nIcing on the badlashes cake: she was over an hour and a half late for my apt and claimed it was never booked. even when I showed her the text she had sent me with the confirmation.  The whole time I was waiting my gut was yelling NO and I should have listened.\\n\\nJust no.My experience went from bad to worse.  This place is filthy and the employees are extremely rude. I pawned an item and when I went back to pick it up the place we closed.  I went back first thing in the morning to pick up the item. I was told that the finance charge was double for being a day late.Horrible experience I went in to get a full set french tips the guy who did them was very rude never said a word only yanked at my hand he cut my real nails after I told him not to. I complained about bubbles and dust inside the acrylic they acted like they couldn\\'t see it. Two days later my nails are lifting and more bubbles appeared. I will never go here again and hope others don\\'t waste their time or money at this place.I hope that every person who follows me, everyone I know and anyone contemplating this establishment reads this first and NEVER bothers to give this place with the crappiest staff of all time a second thought. Earlier today my friend and I dropped in to grab some lunch.. the staff either all lost their dogs this morning, or just have the absolute worst attitudes you\\'ve ever seen in human beings. Not only was the nasty woman who served me avoiding any type of pleasantry but she was yelling across two other workers and a line of patrons asking what I wanted from the other end of the shop. When I asked the server for lettuce, onion and roasted red peppers on my sandwich she quite literally moaned very loud and followed it with yelling \"ughhhhh god help me!\" Before adding my toppings to my turkey sandwich. When one of the other servers asked us if our food was for \"here or to go\" the original server says aloudly \"to-go hopefully!!!\" Wtf... I\\'d love to know who this terrible human being thinks she is! I found my jaw on the floor more than once, wondered why she thought I was such a headache, and my friend and I decided right there that we would NEVER return nor would we let this review go untold to everyone we know!! I feel the owners somehow have to be to blame! How the hell do you allow someone so miserable represent your livelihood? You don\\'t expect livelihood for very much longer, that\\'s how. \\nPs... maybe this server will look a little less \"I just woke up\" at her next job.What a mess. Been in line over an hour and there are still about 10 people in front of me. Should\\'ve stuck with the company I usually use....next counter or two over. Came here based on SW Airlines suggestion and email. UghI did not visit the Kent office, but the office of Dr. Brown in Fairlawn. She was lacking in compassion, clarity, kindness, and professional ethics. She judged me based on my  pharmacutical history, and did not even glance at the stack of medical records I brought with me. I have been treated by some of the best in the country at John Hopkins and Walter Reed, and to be treated so unprofessionally in this office was an insult to the profession. Do NOT waste your time with Dr. Brown!As soon as I parked my car, this rude elderly lady comes out saying these parking spaces are reserved...I UNDERSTAND AND CAN READ THAT ON YOUR SIGN lady.  Just because my other family members are dinning at Hong Kong Garden for Dim Sum does not automatically mean that EVERYONE is looking to eat there.  I was and had a craving for deli sandwiches in which I did ended up walking in to purchase 2 as planned (receipt still in hand).  Don\\'t go around assuming and start off with horrible service.  I ended up keeping my car parked there the WHOLE afternoon taking a space just because that lady was rude.  \\n***Also would be nice to offer water for your customer that is waiting for his to-go order***I am so blown away by this sophisticated & beautiful hotel. One of the best in Las Vegas. The decor is breathe taking, and this place always smell like a magical garden. With so many top notch restaurants, spa services, shows, and clubs to choose from. It\\'s vegas luxury! The last time I stayed here, July 2011, it was such a BIG disappointment. There was a total of 8 of us. One of the bed broke and fell flat to the floor (no, there were no foul play)! 6 out 8 of us left with some kind of bug bite that looks like a terrible case of eczema/rash! The mechanic curtain didn\\'t work. The main T.V. didn\\'t work. Actually, disappointed is an understatement, WE WERE DISGUSTED! How can this 5star resort & hotel failed us so miserably!!!!!? \\n\\n(please view pictures of rash)My husband and I used to order from here more than I\\'d like to admit (almost weekly). The pizza is pretty mediocre, but it\\'s really cheap and convenient. The cheesy bread, subs, chicken fingers, and onion rings are pretty delicious. We always order online (which I love), it\\'s right around the corner, delivery is always under 45 minutes (yes, we\\'re that lazy and really hate winter), and the delivery people are always super nice. Sadly, they had to go and screw up the good thing we had going. \\n\\nLast time we ordered it was for pick-up as 20 years of junk food ordering has taught me pick-up to takes half the time of delivery. We ordered cheesy bread, a Philly sub, and onion rings. I asked for ranch instead of marinara with the cheesy bread and requested ranch for the onion rings.\\n\\nI paid in advance and added a 20% tip (on take-out) thinking that would help make up for any \"inconvenience\" or cost of my ranch requests (we ordered the exact same thing for delivery the previous time with absolutely no problem, by the way). My husband showed up about 20 minutes after I ordered. Not only wasn\\'t the food ready, but apparently they hadn\\'t even started it and were in no hurry. He waited almost another HOUR (seriously--from ordering til he got home was an hour fifteen and it\\'s about a one minute drive) to get our food. They didn\\'t comp or discount or offer any vouchers or coupons or anything. \\n\\nWhen we opened our food there were no sauces of any kind. I\\'d waited a long time and was starving and pretty pissed about this oversight after all that. I hopped in the car because, as I said, it\\'s literally around the corner, and junk food just ain\\'t the same without ranch for dippin. \\n\\nI walked in. Everyone was in the kitchen (no one at the counter), but I was clearly seen, though nobody shouted a greeting or \"I\\'ll be right with you.\" Finally a girl walked toward the front, though again not at a speed that anyone in the restaurant business should use. I told her my husband had just waited a ridiculously long time for our take-out order and when he got home there were no sauces, could I just have like six containers of ranch that we should have gotten with our order. Now that may have been an excessive amount, but I had low blood sugar brain. And at this point I figured they\\'d throw anything at me to appease a dissatisfied customer (because they\\'d screwed up!). Instead, she looked at the computer and said she needed to get the person who took the order. Why? I have no idea. But she said she was new, so I said fine. She went in to the kitchen to tell another girl who dropped what she was doing to go tell an older man, who I assume is the owner, most certainly the boss. Expecting him to greet me with a smile and an apology, or at least a how can I help you, I was taken aback to get a brusk questioning of who I was and what I ordered. He also needed to look it up on the computer for some godforsaken reason. It was like they all had amnesia! You don\\'t remember the tall skinny dude who JUST left after waiting for his order for an hour?! He told me what I ordered like I was on crack and what was the problem. I said yes, I know what I ordered, but I requested ranch, and even added a generous tip in case he wanted to charge me for it. Again, he rudely asked me how many I wanted, incredulous I was asking. It was like the freakin inquisition. Do they have a problem with ranch robberies??? Are people always walking in and making up stories about how they didn\\'t get ranch with their orders?? He started taking containers out of the fridge. I was so upset by this point that I don\\'t even know what he said that prompted me say \"Wow, you are really something else.\" There were four containers of ranch on the counter which I snatched while I could and turned around to walk out, at which point he yelled after me how they\\'re 75 cents a piece. I may have muttered something in return as the door was closing behind me. \\n\\nI honestly think this was the most disrespectful customer service I have ever received. It certainly tops the list as worst interaction/confrontation with a stranger. I can\\'t believe anyone would treat or talk to anyone like that, let alone a proprietor to a customer. I worked in a restaurant for seven years and one of the cardinal rules is own up and apologize when you make a mistake--99% of the time people will completely understand. Offer them a discount or a freebie and the mistake is completely forgotten.\\n\\nI realize no one cares or will ever read this. My husband has already chastised me for wasting my energy on it, but I was just so incredulous about the entire thing. It was cathartic. I feel better. Though that will be of little comfort next time I want cheesy bread (with ranch!) and have to order elsewhere.The location was excellent and the restaurant was beautiful. The food was awful and our server was very rude and impolite.\\nWe were a group of 6 people and whatever we ordered was worse than another one!\\nEven my little daughter who loves french fries couldn\\'t eat them because they weren\\'t fresh and she thought that they were artificial!!!Worse than before.\\nOverpriced, and HORRIBLE service.\\n\\nWhen a group says \"We\\'re really thirsty. Could you please bring water while we look at the menu?\" You\\'d better frickin\\' BRING IT! \\n\\nOur waiter was pushy, rude, and S...L...O...W...\\nWhen we said that we weren\\'t interested in hearing the specials, he read them anyway. \\n\\nHe constantly tried to upsell us. Every order placed was followed by a pause, and \"Well, you know what would be really good...?\" followed by a big description of a more expensive item or an add-on.\\n\\nThe desperately needed water took almost twenty minutes to get to our table.\\n\\nThe table next to us, who was seated at least five minutes after us, received their water, drinks, and first course before we even got our water. \\n\\nDo I sound like I\\'m obsessing about water? In the desert, dehydration is no joke, and it\\'s indicative of the quality (bad - very very bad) of service that we received.\\n\\nThe sushi was good, but not great.\\nThe main courses were simple but extremely expensive.\\nAll sides were extra.\\nWe spent about $250 for three people on very basic food and a glass of wine each.\\n\\nNever again.\\nNever never never.Do your research people, this place is completely unprofessional. I went in for a Juvederm procedure in my lips, and I was very disappointed by the way I looked right after the procedure and even several weeks after. My lips were extremely painful, swollen, bruised, and disproportioned. This place is not a good place to go to for lip augmentation, be aware. Choose a good MD.It\\'s extremely annoying that the Venetian chooses to broadcast Fox News at their VIP lounges against their customers\\' will and employees\\' will.  I would consider this harassment since neither have a choice to change the channel. I\\'ve tried. I have complained to the employees who state they are not able to change the channel. Trust me, the Venetian customers and their employees do NOT want to be forced to watch Fox News. Please change to a neutral channel or CNN which provides more transparent news.I\\'m a regular at chipotle in California, this is my first visit to this chipotle on s.las Vegas strip.this is pretty new place I think, I took a veggie bowl in which the rice was undone and the fajitas were all burnt, the quantity offered was less than usual. I\\'m very unhappy with this place.The worst. Got there 45 minutes after the store was supposed to be open and they weren\\'t ready.  Ordered a sandwich and the oven hadn\\'t been turned on.  I asked how long and the employee said a few minutes. 8 minutes later oven still not preheated and I let her know I had to go.  She then pulls the sandwich out of the oven.  Cleary the sandwich would not have been prepared correctly.  I did not take sandwich and had to leave to get to an appointment. My  quick stop for a coffee and breakfast to go was over 15 minutes.  When I sent in a complaint to the head office the slow response was they couldn\\'t give me a credit but would send over coupons for a couple of beverages.  That is ridiculous.  I wanted a refund on the sandwich I never took. I pass by this second cup 5 days a week. I\\'m going to keep on driving and stick with Starbucks. You should also steer clear. Best example of the worst service.Oh man this is going to be a long review so if you want the gist, god awful, do not go. I was so dissapointed with everything that once I got home I had to write a review.  First of All I am Vietnamese and Pho is such a soulful dish, the pho I had today was the worst thing ever.  My parents came to visit with my sister and a friend, and after a long day we wanted to finish with a hot bowl of pho.  I have seen this place, I have even walked by it when I ate at Sura.  There was a smell so tantalizing that I had to go and try it. I thought it would be a good idea to try Jenni Pho Grill tonight.\\n\\nWe walk in saw that the place was not too busy maybe about 7 tables.  We got seated fairly quickly.  Our server was pretty nice, my parents attempted to order in vietnamese but the server informed us that he did not speak it.  Cool cool, no big deal, he seemed like a nice kid.  After that it went downhill from there.  We ordered three bowls of the Pho Dac biet, and two orders of the pho tai.  We finished our order with two thai teas, the jenni jelly drink, and two waters.  \\n\\nMy family waited around, no waters, no drinks nothing.  We watched three tables get seated order their food and get their food before we even had anything on our table!  after a 25 min wait, our waiter finally comes back with two waters.  We asked why the service was so slow, he stated that there was only two waiters and said sorry.  So it was fine for now.  After we got the water nothing else came to us.  We watched as the tables that came in after us eat, and one even finished before we were served.  After another 35 minutes, our food finally came out.  First the two dac biet bowls, then the last three.  Finally the drinks came out as well.  I have worked at a boba place before, making thai teas should not take a hour.  For waiting for so long I was really anticipating for a great bowl of pho.  Oh man was I wrong.  The broth was lukewarm, it could not even finish cooking my meat.  The broth tasty funky as if it was made with a pre made powder.  My parents and I watched a one cook was constantly tasting the broth, and we saw no bones that make a great broth.  The bowl was mostly disappointing broth.  There were very little meat and noodles.  We ate, and we wanted to get out as soon as possible.  We asked for a to go cup for the thai tea because it took so long we were just going to take it home.  It took almost another five minutes just to get a plastic cup.  \\n\\nIn the end it was just terrible.  My family and I went home unhappy.  And the thing is I love food, I work in the industry so I timing is very important.  Having only two servers is rough but it can not be the only excuse.  If there was something wrong or if it was going to take a little longer, they should inform the customers.  The worst part was watching tables come in before us and eat before we got anything.  I am never going back.  I really hope they clean up their act, there are a lot of pho places out here and if they don\\'t fix things it will be buried beneath the rest.Worst service ever.  Only one here and took 10 minutes to get one drink out.  3 people behind the counter including the manager.  They were all talking and doing other things--LOOK AT MY PICTURE!!! \\n\\nThis is a picture of an **INSECT that I was about to eat!! I was really hungry and decide to stop by and eat.. Thank goodness this was my second plate and I wasn\\'t too full because I gulped down the first plate.. This is your soup of toscana that I was served. \\n\\nManagement provided a friendly compensation, but I don\\'t want anyone to get poisoned, sooo yeah, eat at your own risk!!I e-mailed head office months ago about a lousy experience at their Yonge & College Street location and never received a response. Was never a huge fan to begin with but that confirmed things for me. \\n\\nOh, and the Cobb salad doesn\\'t have chicken in it anymore...what a rip off!This is for service only.  On a 2000 Honda Accord Vtec EX.  Had major service done here: 1. timing belt, water pump, tune up, etc.  Basically everything that was recommended and told needed to be done.  Wanted the car to be reliable and not have any issues so I went ahead with all the required maintenance and then some.\\n\\n1 month after all this major service the radiator blew open coming back from flagstaff.....Ok so I understand things break etc.  I take it to Arrowhead Honda Service and the explanation was since I replaced the water pump with a new one it must have increased pressure in the system. Since the radiator was old the new water pump found a weakness in the radiator.  I was then told it was common??? OK I get the explanation, but if that was the case a month a go and common knowledge why not recommend replacing the radiator with the major service so the car would not leave me stranded???\\n\\nThey also had recommended the power steering pump be replaced, system flushed etc.  Hate when its not done right the first time?  Had to bring it back and wait for them to get air out of the system so the new power steering pump would stop making noise.  \\n\\nI went to this dealership service department because they know Honda\\'s better then me and what breaks, unfortunately even when I changed everything they initially recommended they still missed other items that should of been changed.  I have not been back since this mistake....Good luck getting an appointment  before you end up in the E.R.Worst experience ever.... I guess it\\'s my first time left negative comments but definitely for me won\\'t go back anymore. I have made reservation for the day and when I arrive they told me they don\\'t remember they have confirmed my appointment n already other guests waiting there but they re closing in a hour. Still the lady told me it\\'s ok they could do it. So I sit down n soak my feet into cold water... n after 20 mins, the lady told me n another girl that actually they could not help us today as they re closing soon n one of the staff actually have to leave soon... so I don\\'t know how good they re as I guess I ll never know:(Will not offer refund and will charge you for cancelled flight. Even a month in advance i tried and they will not work with me. Dont use this cut rate airlineI\\'m truly disgusted by the service of this restaurant.  I came in with my family (Mom and Dad) and they said 10 minute wait, we said okay, we notice that they were short with their staff so we waited patiently till we were seated at a table, but that 10 minutes turned into a 30min wait. So the hostess sat us at a table saying how there may be awhile wait, after seeing 2 servers walk by us like we didn\\'t exist, the hostess later seated another table which were 4 Caucasian customers, we were still patiently waited for around another 30min, when those 4 sat down an Asian waiter quickly came to take their order, I got the waiters attention and said excuse me, we came here first. And she made up an excuse saying how \"Oh we wait on different tables probably your waiter is busy\" I knew this was an excuse, I was so disgusted. So we told the hostess that this waiter is waiting on a table after us, and she said oh well we said there would probably be a long wait, and the hostess had the audacity to say \"Oh but they serve the people who come before\" and I said, we were before them, we been waiting 30min at this table and you know this because you sat us at our table\" she said it depends. So in the end we left the restaurant hungry and went to a much better restaurant which served us very well, called Rice Paper.If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. They are RUDE, unprofessional and they have personal lockers that you HAVE to put your purse in to shop with them. I was asked to go and put my purse in my car. Excuse me?! Is this even legal? Are you going to replace my purse and it\\'s contents if someone steals my personal items? I\\'m not sure who is running this place but this insane policy is CLEARLY negatively impacting you business. BAD move, BAD business move. Go across the street to Sally\\'s.Quite possibly the worst meal I have had in ages.  The service was glacial.  I ordered a house salad, but was told not all the ingredients listed on the menu were available.  I ended up with a plate of arugula and a tomato with some not-so-tasty French dressing  We waited for over an hour for the main course to arrive--General Jackson\\'s Chicken.  The menu promises:  \"Boneless, marinated chicken deep fried and tossed in spicy, savory sauce, served with jasmine rice, broccoli and napa\"  Spicey sauce?  This sauce was so spicy I was unable to even taste the chicken.  The rice was strictly Uncle Ben\\'s and i saw no broccoli or napa.  We had a couple beers before the meal while waiting.. Total bill:  $55.  I\\'m not a tightwad, but dinner in a little strip mall restaurant should not set you back $55--or else it should be delectable.  Battiste and Dupree was not the \"hidden gem\" others had told me about.  Hope your mileage differs.First time buyer,\\nI was excited to go in buy my first car the last week of November 2014. At the beginning the owner was very nice and was giving all the details of the car I bought a Mini Cooper. Knowing that it had issues in the transmission. Witch he promised he would cover with and insurance ASC warranty a Vehicle Protection Plan within three months or 3000 miles. I contacted him several times for him to get my car fixed he kept saying that he would fix it after the holidays. January, February passed the car was not fix yet. I contacted him one las time, I told him that I would give him one more month than he told me that he has been working on it still. He told me that it was an imported part witch was not easy to find. I told him I will take legal action and he than answered with \\'\\' do whatever you have to do\\'\\' with a arrogant tone so unprofessional till now I can say that he has NEVER!!! Contacted me!!! To keep me updated or give me a solution. I believe I have been more than patient at this time it is incredible how they claim to be a legal business. I will be contacting him again and demand a solution. I highly suggest you think twice about going here. I have read another review regarding several comparable issues. I have never had this experience and it is horrible driving your first car with a bad transmission.\\nI really want to warn you do not go here!!! \\nI have never written a review but I really want let people know that these people are committing fraud!!!\\n\\n\\n\\nBE AWARE OF THIS LOCATION!I was very disappointed with the customer service from the server to the owner which really surprised me, what a BITCH!  I ordered a western omelet with hash browns crispy and when I got the omelet there was no cheese in it. The hash browns were barely cooked. In addition, we wanted coffee refills and no one ever came back to ask us!!  When I inquired about the no cheese the server told me no it doesn\\'t come with it, and when I asked the owner she said that that isn\\'t the correct way western omelets traditionally  are served! She argued with me about the history of the western omelet instead she should have been more focused on her customers being happy, especially since we I told her it was our first time there and we were excited to try her food Quite honestly, I don\\'t look for a class lesson when I go out to eat I just want good food and good customer service, I got neither today!  The correct thing for the server and the half wit owner would have been to say, \" sorry sir but I would be happy to redo your omelet with cheese and make u another order of hash browns and make sure they are crispy\".  But guess what none of that happened!  I have cooked in restaurant my whole life and I have never heard of any omelet not coming with some type of cheese and even if she was correct in her history, she definitely failed me at her customer service skills. In addition, when paying for my food I was told that they only take cash so I had to go out and get cash to pay for this horrible experience and that didn\\'t sit well with me, I almost said screwed it, but my conscience said don\\'t do it, so I went back and paid my bill.  Long story short, if you want good customer service and u want good food I would recommend going to Denny\\'s or Bob Evans. Oh yeah one more thing, if no stars were a choice I would have put none!!!To start, its a beautiful venue. Definitely a hidden gem in the GTA. But please be very very careful and get everything in writing. George Christakis the co-owner of this venue and manager of Crystal Fountain is very devious and sketchy. \\n\\nWe had checked out a few venues, one being Crystal Fountain, where we met George. He was definitely rude, and lacked professionalism. We left with a very bad impression.\\n\\nFast forward a few week, and we spotted Estate banquet, we emailed and arranged to meet up. We showed up and the one we had the appointment with was no where to be seen, having passed our meeting off to someone else without informing us. The venue is beautiful an price was in our budget and we wanted to proceed once we could work out the food details. My girlfriend did not like the unprofessional manner of George, whom I later found out when I asked is indeed the same George from Crystal Fountain.\\n\\nWe called George the next day to discuss food options, and he said yes everything we wanted we could have for the price we discussed. Tasting was included for 6 people. I asked him to send me an email confirming what we spoke about on the phone. When the email arrived it simply had generics such as \"assorted veggies, assorted cakes, hors d\\'oeuvres\" as well as a tasting for 2 people. As well he upped the amount of people we had to guarantee for the price.\\n\\nWhen we called back to discuss, he verbally told us again what it would include, but when I asked him to email us specifics, he refused. In a very arrogant tone he informed us that he was an expert in his field, and he does not give specifics. That grilled veggies, will be based on what he can buy for that price when the wedding arrives, almost a year later. That it\\'s his discretion what desserts and pastries he would provide. \\n\\nNeedless to say, I told him unless we could establish a written contract outlining what he would be providing for the price we were paying, we would be walking away. He said no way is he going to put anything details down in writing, and that we were to trust him. We walked.\\n\\nPlease be very wary of this George, he is very unscrupulous. The venue itself it nice, and private, but no way was I going to ruin such a special day by getting involved with such shady business dealings.I had a Engine in warranty from LKQ, these guys were to install its replacement.. They told me done in a few days, ok...   I went there and noticed when the engine was taken out they carelessly left my AC dangling and did not remove it to install new engine. No big deal till you understand the rest.. this is a cheap way to not refill system and do it right...  After going to get my car when they said it was done I Notice AC didn\\'t work and wrong Coolant added to Radiator. ( cannot use regular Green... Yellow Ford required ) Then I say I will come get it when they fix the AC, they tell me hours later its the PCM..( Computer ) well OK you guys shorted it out, the only thing wrong was a Valve Rattle, now this?? After 2 days with LKQ saying they are going to send a inspector I drove past and noticed my Mirrors Loose (broken ) on BOTH SIDES!! I am ANAL when it comes to my car I bought New in 2007..  this was enough, I took it home.. I had enough...  They forgot 4 bolts, 2 in wrong spot, One Digging into Power Steering Rack, Power steering Bottle Cracked on Bottom from a Poor removal and hid the fact it was cracked on the lower nipple and the AC system they claimed did not hold R-134a because they DID remove the AC later and LOST the O-Rings when they filled it, it leaked.. and they SHORTED the AC Protective Diode.. IT WAS NOT THE PCM.. this place MIGHT be good for a Oil Change if you tell them how to do it, but that\\'s all..  Telling me How Do we know you didn\\'t bring it in here like this... BAHAHAHA, a back yard weekend mechanic was able to figure out they were unskilled for the task.. I will make sure with a HUGE online review on EVERY Review site that this place is NOT the place to take a Car... or a peddle bike for that matter..\\n\\nI replaced the o-rings, pulled the diode and got the ac working after I vacuumed it and refilled, what armatures..  I guess I got to go to ford, spend $80 on a new Power steering Bottle and tell LKQ to send me the money..\\n\\nWhen they first got my car knowing it was under warranty from LKQ they tried to get me to pay them the other $45 per hour on top of the $55 an hour they were getting under warranty... I told them do not touch it until I contact LKQ, they tried to scam me out of $45 an hour x12 hours.... I am not stupid..  LKQ should have pulled it out right there and then, but no.. they agreed to do it for the $55 an hour, but the skill these guys have isn\\'t worth Minimum wage..Over priced nasty nachos. The meat was so salty I couldn\\'t eat them. And they tried to sell me a regular bottled water for $7. I will never go to this place again!!! This place sucks!!Was amazing the first visit (when corporate was still overseeing their operations during the first few weeks of opening). The second visit was horrible.  We won\\'t be returning. The salads were watery and tasteless, the fries were old burnt and overseasoned, the restaurant was dirty and the tables sticky, and the staff was impatient and unprofessional.Terrible customer service , overprice , only one mechanic at the shop , 3 weeks to fix my bike ; owner dale kieffer so rude I never come back again.... Yamaha dealer same price excellent serviceWish I could give this place 0 stars. We have had issues here before with being seated (it took them 15 minutes when the place was empty one time), but tonight takes the cake. \\n     We went to get food at 2am, pulled into the drive thru at 2:32. We waited there for 15 minutes, then we got trapped in the drive thru by a curb and other vehicles for 25 more minutes. I got incredibly fed up and walked inside. There were 2 tables seated - and they were already eating. One woman was ordering at the counter when I went in. \\n     I asked the worker at the counter if they shut down the drive thru and if they could inform the people waiting at the speaker because we were stuck and just wanted to leave. All he said is \"I don\\'t know if they shut down the drive thru but I can take your order here.\" Like THAT DOESNT HELP US. We are STILL stuck in your crappy little drive thru and we don\\'t even want to order here anymore. He said he would meet me outside - which he DIDNT by the way, but the line started to move so we said whatever and decided to still order because we had already waited 40 minutes.\\n     After they got the person in front of us through the drive thru, they then told US to hold on a minutes because they are \"backed up inside\", but they weren\\'t at all. The parking lot had 2 cars and 3 people behind us in line, and when I was inside, a server was sitting at a table texting. So don\\'t tell me you are busy if your staff is getting paid for nothing. I yelled \"are you getting paid for this?\" Through the speaker and he had time to answer and tell me to CALM DOWN but couldn\\'t take my damn order.\\n     We finally left with out even PLACING an order after 49 minutes. Will not return and by the other reviews for this place, I should have checked yelp before ever coming here in the first place. Went to the Mentor one after and got served right away.I didn\\'t listen to the low reviews, I wish I did. Literally the worst. We went through two of their routers that both broke. One didn\\'t get us anywhere near the speed we were paying for, I called and chatted with multiple people before we could get a replacement router. Finally got the replacement and things seemed okay, but no, it completely broke in less than a month. It won\\'t even turn on anymore. They suggested we go buy a new router from Best Buy, who btw doesn\\'t sell dsl routers anymore wtf!? They charge you ridiculous shipping prices for the replacement for their item that doesn\\'t work properly! Every time you chat with them you get different answers and they transfer you to about 10 people before they even get close to answering your question. \\nDo not use this service, it might be cheaper but not cheap enough to deal with all this BS they put you though.Below average food. The service can be spotty, depending on the time of day.\\n\\nJust..look elsehwere. I\\'m surprised they are still in business.If you can avoid this company, I recommend you do so. They are in the midst of overcharging me $100 for nothing, and insist I have to prove I don\\'t owe it by going to their inconveniently located offices. They won\\'t take a letter or FAX. Rude on the phone to me.  You have to watch them every month, as we have had other bills that were inaccurate (overbilling us) before, too. NO, I do not recommend.Dismal, lukewarm, defrosted-tasting \"TexMex\" glop;\\n\\nMumbly, unengaged waiter;\\n\\nClueless manager, who seeing us with barely nibbled entrees\\non plates shoved forward for pickup, thanked us\\nperfunctorily for our patronage;\\n\\nWe\\'re from the Texas Hill Country;\\ndown there, we jail critters \\nwho serve up grub this bad,\\nfor their own protection.\\n\\nNever, never, NEVER again\\n(Back to Yard House for real food)Don\\'t go here. Especially not for a full hour table massage. I\\'ve never tried the chair massages so I can\\'t speak to those, but the table massage was not a great experience. I\\'ll spare the details, but I definitely don\\'t recommend this place.I booked a session and decided to also use my coupon for free Easter collage. The girl told me it would take 45 min to print. Showed up 45min later and I guess they were having issues formatting it to print out correctly. Hour and a half total spent waiting and the guy kept saying if you wait I\\'ll give a free print. I had already waited hour and a half along with session time and a five month old wasn\\'t going to deal with it much longer. I don\\'t travel to chandler often and live 30min from this location. I told them they needed to mail it to me and I left furious. Never again!\\n\\nUpdate: The area manager did contact me and had my missing photos mailed and also had one of them framed for me.Came here on a whim to try it out with my fiancée and we were not impressed at all. Ordered the street corn queso and it was super lacking on flavor and also pulled a large chunk of butter from it. Tried to save it a little with the sauce tray and even added salsa to it and still wasn\\'t there. My Sonoran dog looked like it was from the previous day... typical dry wrinkled no snap day-old dog, the brioche bun was soggy from too much butter. And the tacos were cold. We Couldn\\'t even finish the meal. The salsa was the only highlight of the lunch. Also watched a server shatter a glass over the ice well and proceed to use the ice that the glass had broken into to serve a customer. I will NEVER return.Very disappointing, the price is too expensive for the food quality.   First of all, there is no green tea or red bean  ice cream on the menu.   They only have ice cream bar, and it is only one per person, on the menu, they didn\\'t say that is limited. Secondly, way too much rice on the sushi. I guess thats how they make the money. Lastly, the ipad service is stupid. you have to wait for someone to confirm it. Overall, not a good reataurant for sushi.There was hair in our food and drinks - multiple times!  We had to send out food and drinks back 3 different times. \\n\\nWe were about 10 deep in out party.  2 booths seated directly next to each other. One table ordered chicken tacos.  The minute the server sat the plate down we noticed there was hair in it.  She took it right back.  \\nOne of our Margaritas came out immediately after .. there was a long strain of hair floating on top.  The server took it right away and apologized - again.  The other table ordered nachos .. and guess what ... hair was it ... stuck in the Queso.  This time the server stood there and waited until we looked over the nachos.  We both noticed the hair.  He said WOW!  You guys see it\\'s not my hair (he had a short brown cut with a cap on).   He again, returned the nachos and we decided not to order anything else.  \\n\\nI\\'ll never return!They worry about their therapist but not their customers. I\\'ve been going on here for awhile and one time I missed and forgot about my appointment they charged me $60. They said that\\'s the least they charge. Normally it\\'s full price of your service. If it was so important not to miss an appointment why don\\'t they give an automated text reminder within 1-2 hours of appointment like other places???The most important thing for a restaurant is food safety and clean. See what I got from my dish. Other bugs maybe still forgivable. But cockroach means this restaurant is really dirty nasty and not take their kitchen clean job seriously.I was sent to Vision Source South Hills for a second opinion. I enjoyed my appointments with Dr. Strain and found her to be knowledgable and attentive. However, I was incredibly displeased with how I was treated by the staff. I went through my vision insurance with a staff member and assumed this information was added to my file. I called a month or so later to order contacts and was told I could not pay for the contacts when I came and picked them up; I needed to pay for them over the phone. I have never paid for contacts before picking them up before but I figured it wasn\\'t a big deal, just differences between offices. Once I got the statement for my order, I realized that they had charged me the full amount and not run anything through my insurance company. I called back and was met with no answers, saying they would call me back later. They never did, so I called back again and finally learned that my vision insurance had never been added to my file. After going through my information a second time, they then assured me they would file a claim with my insurance company and I would receive a check soon. Never once in this back and forth did anyone from the staff apologize or recognize that they had made a mistake. In fact, everyone I talked to seemed more agitated that they now had to reprocess the claim. A month later, I received my refund along with an updated billing statement. Amongst the revised patient/insurance payment was a statement describing why the revision was necessary. It read: \"patient originally did not say to use insurance and paid in full for contacts-decided a few days later she would like us to bill vsp and refund her the remaining balance\". This is the first medical establishment I have come in contact with that required me to advise them of my desire to use my medical insurance. Professional medical establishments run benefit checks and inform the customer of their costs prior to performing the service. While I feel Dr. Strain is a highly qualified ophthalmologist, I am exceedingly disappointed in the professionalism and efficiency of the office staff. At this point, I do not see myself returning in the future.My husband and I ordered our wedding cake here. We saw this beautiful white 3 tiered pyramid shaped cake in a then really big Julia Robert\\'s movie and really wanted that one. We went in to Baker Wee to see if they could make it. The owners were not there and we were told by the manager lady we spoke to that she will be the one making the cake anyway. She saw the movie too and knew exactly what cake we were asking for. We even made a 2D drawing of it, she wrote down her notes and took the order. She said she will rent the movie so she can take one more look at it before she makes it. Fast forward to our wedding day....we arrived at the restaurant where our dinner reception was and for the first time we got to see our cake. WOW! We almost fainted. I should include pictures because there\\'s just no way to describe how ugly it was. The original agreement in size was a 12\" x 12\" square and 10-12\" tall, like I said pyramid. We got an 8\" square base, next layer 6\" base and the top layer 4\" base and the whole cake was 2 feet tall! It looked like a Chinese pagoda. The layers were on 4\" tall sticks. And the best part: it was airbrushed with brown color like marble and had brown 1/2\" diameter ball on the top.. -   Turned out, the owner (who has never seen the movie - or apparently a pyramid before ) ended up making the cake, never called us or the manager lady with questions, just tried to figure it out from the her notes. This was her understanding of it.  We were so embarrassed all night, everyone kept asking what the cake was supposed to be? We just kept saying: a snow white pyramid. Next morning we drove down to the bakery, furious. She said she will not refund the $300 we spent on it because she worked on it all day and she did her best. She said she was sorry and we can have a basic cake ($30 value) for free. We did get that cake a few week later for a birthday and never ever returned to Baker Wee again. It\\'s very sad how greatly it impacted our special day. We should have demanded a refund but we gave up on the arguing back and fourth - it didn\\'t change anything. After all we didn\\'t want the money, we wanted the cake. So anyway, I would not recommend them if they were the last bakery, I  would rather make a homemade cake. I also wish there was a way to choose 0 stars on this on.Besides this Walmart being ghetto they are inconsistent. They charged about 15/16 dollars more on my oil changedTerrible Gym, the ceiling in the mens shower room is falling apart, Sauna has not worked properly for 6 months, change rooms are freezing cold in the winter and the Management could care less. Stay away from this Good life.They don\\'t deserve any stars! \\nI am from out of state and my check engine light comes on and I have to get back on the road today. No, I don\\'t have an appt. it\\'s not like I know I need to get an oil change. Mazda: Sorry I can try to work you in but it\\'s not fair to the other customers. How about appeasing the customer that is about to get on the road just to find out what\\'s wrong and if I can safely drive home?  I didn\\'t know my check engine light was going to come on. I understand about appt\\'s but gee you can\\'t just see what the issue may be and if I can drive it.I don\\'t normally like to do this, but I have to after the terrible experience I just had. Centurylink has the WORST customer service I\\'ve ever experienced. Two weeks ago I put in my order and the tech was scheduled to come in yesterday. Nobody showed up and nobody called to reschedule. Today I called, was on the phone for almost two hours, transferred to four people and was told they had to reschedule for Thursday, there was nothing they could do to help me earlier. I even talked to a supervisor who was the worst \"supervisor\" I\\'ve ever dealt with. Two hours later and I now have to wait until Thursday. Nobody apologized, nobody seemed to care. I told them if they don\\'t come Thursday I\\'ll be cancelling my service and going with Cox. Also, this whole time I was on their site talking with a live customer service rep online trying to figure this out, but all they told me was they couldn\\'t do anything. So today\\'s Worst Company Award goes to Centurylink.Worst Starbucks EVER!!!! The wait time is always crazy here no matter what time they only have one person working, they are always out of the baked goods in particular the cake pops is what i like.... so would not suggest this Starbucks to stop into... unless you have absolutely nothing to do and nowhere to be because you will be waiting.Very rude staff. Slow little to no communication between the team. Very grumpy short responses from multiple staff. \\n\\nThen they kept getting orders wrong and had the nerve to argue with a lady about it. Causing the line to go slower...don\\'t argue make it right. \\n\\nStarbucks NYNY was very disappointing today. Wouldn\\'t recommend coming back to this one.Reservation = walk in.  Pointless to make reservations.  We made a reservation the day before for 11:00am the next day morning. When we arrived we are not being served but was asked to wait.  This is  pointless for reservation, as at the same time they still take walk in and people who has reservation is under the same queue with the walk in.  After 30min, we asked how much longer will be the wait? The lady answered \"no idea, I don\\'t know\". Avoid this restaurant.Frybread is good, but there isn\\'t enough substance. I got some watered down beans, hardly any ground beef and mostly lettuce.Never had a problem at this one until today. Guess they were to busy to care about the quality of their food. I ordered my regular Asiago ranch spicy chicken sandwich. Got my food at the window I always do a quality check no matter what, looked at my sandwich and it had honey mustard on it, last time I checked honey mustard and ranch were two different things. So I sent it back, the girl who made it came to the window and argued that it was made correctly. I said no, because Asiago ranch isn\\'t yellow and doesn\\'t taste like honey mustard.  She said I know I made it right I said ok, well I don\\'t want it. So she took it back brought me another one this time a regular chicken sandwich with a ranch packet. Yeah I paid 7 dollars for a ranch packet with a chicken sandwich. Sweet girl right, nasty attitude to boot. So I took it into the store this time, and the manager showed me the ranch in the bottle that was suppose to be on my sandwich and remade it. Wow imagine that someone who new how to make it without attitude. I\\'m still very disappointed money is money no matter where you spend it at. And I expect to get what I ask for with my money. Not something you just feel like free styling.I was treated to lunch here and even for a free lunch it was not satisfying.\\n\\nFirst my french onion soup had very little flavor, almost watered down.  The cheese was overcooked and clumping and the bread was just... bread in my soup.\\n\\nI had the short ribs for my entree.  The ribs where extremely dry and overcooked.  The portions are small and the meat was so inedible that I didn\\'t even finish my meal.  What flavor that was infused was just sauce cooked onto the meat and no flavor from the meat itself.  I was extremely disappointed.\\n\\nMy guess is that they garner the majority of their business from out of towners staying in the hotel it is connected to.  This will definitely not be in my lunch rotation downtown.Very overpriced for what you get. I had the skirt steak which was stringy and tough. I\\'ve had much better meals at mad mex. Our server was extremely impersonal and we were rushed out. Will not return.Just got one of the worst haircuts of my life from a girl named Alex. Had to go home and use my own clippers to cut away her terrible job! TERRIBLE! BewareYeah, service continues to go downhill. Take your money elsewhere.  \\n\\nPaid for the works. They didn\\'t even wipe the dash or any of the interior. Outside still has crap all over it. Should have gone back inside and asked for a refund. \\n\\nThis place sucks.My daughter and her boyfriend were very excited to go here. They paid almost $200 for 2 Buffet of Buffet 24 hour passes . They had crab sushi shrimp and oysters. \\nThen about 2 hours later she started feeling very Sick . For the next 2 days she could barely move , vomiting , diarrhea cold sweats . Her whole vacation was ruined. \\nWe returned to the Rio seafood buffet talked to manager MIKE . \\nFilled out the security forms  with the EMT .   \\nMike tells us that even though she got food poisoning from there seafood . And could not use the 24 hour pass . He could not give a refund. But He offered a free buffet if she wanted to eat there again... Really ???  \\nGood luck eating here!!!!\\nYou go to a casino to gamble money ,not your health!I called them at 10.30 saying ill be there in 15 minutes given they close at 11. When I arrived with a party of 15 ( which I mentioned on the phone) they denied me and were extremely rude. Lack of professionalism and courtesy.Previously, my review was removed. So let\\'s try again. I started to come here in 2011 and I LOVED Neos. But now, if I could I would give this place a ZERO.  Sherrie was the girl that always did my laser and it was comfortable to be around. As my six treatments went up, I signed up and made a new package, and then soon again, those six were up, and I signed up again. THIS TIME THOUGH, I spoke to Monica before I signed anything. I wanted to make sure I would get a refund for any treatments if Sherrie was to leave or if they were to move locations because I was well aware that their policies are not very consumer-friendly. Well, guess what? They moved locations and nobody told me and my appt. had been cancelled. I called Neos to see what the deal was and Brian was super rude and said he would never agree to a refund, even though it is written in my chart. He said he can \"make it worth my while\" to drive all the way to another office which is 45 minutes from my house when I was only driving 20 to Peoria. He offered me a free microderm... I\\'m 20 and I told him I don\\'t want one and he said that he would suggest it since my face needs a \"detailing\".... If that isn\\'t rude I don\\'t know what is. It gets better because he told me his tech Charlene is great and that she is BETTER then Sherrie and has a lot more experience. I did not think that it was professional to talk trash about former employees... especially when I have done so many  treatments with them. I have requested my chart to be faxed to me and nobody has gotten back to me. I had two treatments left and he wouldn\\'t refund those treatments, even though I have been a loyal customer for so long. Instead of microderms, how about paying for gas and miles? Super rude service, DO NOT GO HERE.We order from this Pizza Hut often and always order a very similar order a stuff crust pizza with chicken, Bacon, and onion on half. We ordered today and the pizza had onion on the whole thing. The manager was rude and didn\\'t want to replace the pizza. After telling him I will come in and talk to the store manager did he change his attitude toward the situation.Flies on the pizza that was sitting out there.  Ew.  Very disgusting.  I would NOT recommend it ... very unsanitary!Cheap tickets, awful staff, probably a good idea they got the self serve kiosks. The remodel is nice but doesn\\'t make up for the lousy customer service and rude popcorn makersIf you looking for the good customer service stay away from this restaurant, the lady work from here never say hi to the customer i went this restaurant yesterday i was so surprised her rude attitude to customer i asked her to about seat and she said \"just go seat any where!\" I still dont know why she answer me with harsh tone voiceworst experience I\\'ve ever had with dr. Torres I found out I was pregnant in July  but ended up  having a miscarriage in September . few appointments that I had with him he was very cold shouldered and I didn\\'t feel he was really listening to what I had to say about my pregnancy that far. apparently after my 1st blood tests my estrogen was low so he prescribed me Progesterone 100 milligrams once a day. things didn\\'t work out so come end of September I ended up scheduling a D&C. at that appointment he expressed that I probably have an estrogen issue since this was my 2nd miscarriage. He didn\\'t know that by now????? smh...already frustrated with this location & this doc I was told I had to get went a follow-up. I did & he didn\\'t even check me (didn\\'t undress), he only asked me a few questions anything wrong, if I was trying to get pregnant again right away, if I want birth control pills and that was prety much the end of the visit. This doc didn\\'t seem to care about my well being and didn\\'t care enough to take better precautions with my blood results. oh & while he was asking me questions before my surgery he answered a personal call in front of me...he was talking about his hurt hip, a trip aka vacation, that he feels better now & he got rest... then slowly walked out of my room. horrible!!! the waiting time for this location is 2hrs plus. I would not go to this location!!!!!I have noticed when 2 guests come and sit on a 4-seating table, the owner always makes it a point to move them saying that maybe there will be a lot of people who in and it will be a hassle to move them later so they shift to the smaller tables.\\ni consider it pretty rude to do that when almost all the tables are empty and in the 2 days I visited, the restaurant was never completely full.RUN RUN RUN!!! This is a sham up one side and down the other!! We rented an economy car, like we have 40 times (we are locals). We prepaid through carrentals.com. It CLEARLY STATES on the agreement...UNLIMITED MILES.....I drop my husband off to get our PREPAID RENTAL CAR from EZ SLEEZY CAR RENTALS OF LAS VEGAS! When hubby gets to the counter...GUESS WHAT...she said YOU ARE LOCALS... you need to bring a bill from home to PROVE WHERE YOU LIVE...and you only get 150 miles per day and you need to pay a big fat deposit and and and..IT CLEARLY SAYS ON CONTRACT....unlimited miles...paid in full...The rude B$TCH at the counter was a horrible wench with a horrible attitude...she was just a nasty person.So my husband walked over to HERTZ...rented a car....paid and because it was in person they did a 200.00 hold (which is fine) it was 20.00 more for 1 day less than EZ SHIT HOLE NASTY CAR SCAM NOT RENT AL. Then on the contract it says NO REFUNDS NO MATTER WHAT....   SERIOUSLY!?  They broke the contract but changing ALLLLL the terms As a local...THEY ARE VERY PREJUDICE TOWARDS US...and we are a \"disabled vet marine\" and a \"business owner\" with a \"5 year old child \" with us. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE..what glitter here is NOT GOLD...it is lie steal and cheat the customers...GO TO ANYWHERE other than this rip off place...what a freaking NIGHTMARE!!! If you are LOCAL....DO NOT COME HERE AT ALL!!!  If you purchase online...DOES NOT MATTER you are screwed...plan on getting a car somewhere else and plan an additional chunk of money you wont have for your vacation!!  RUN RUN RUN..unless you like the run around , getting ripped off and having nightmares. We have used all the other companies there....this is the ONLY ONE we had a problem with...it was the WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!  This rental was April 2015I have visited this location three times. The staff is nice, but they get the order wrong every time and sometimes they are out of things that should be standard for an ice cream shop (out of hot fudge? At 6pm?). I know, \"first world problems\". :) I can understand one visit being disappointed, but three in a row? We probably won\\'t be back. We\\'ll give the local ice cream place across the street (Carolina Creamery) a try.For the first I\\'ve ever noticed, I think I was just cheated on gasoline!\\n\\nI was near empty, and just got a fill up here where 20.5 gallons were poured. Generally near empty, the max I\\'ve ever seen is 18 - 18.2, because there\\'s reserves.\\n\\nI just looked it up, and I have a 20 gallon tank in my vehicle AFTER reserves are taken into account. \\n\\nThere\\'s definitely something off here. The machines need to be calibrated properly. \\n\\nOtherwise, it seems fine. Kind of dingy for a Terrible\\'s location. I also wouldn\\'t use their car wash. It\\'s the \"touchy\" kind that gives your car a million little scrapes, ruining the paint job, especially apparent if you have a dark car.\\n\\nIf they fix their thieving ways, I\\'d give \\'em 3 to 3.5 stars. For more, they\\'d need a serious cleaning and update.When.she told me that the oven is 2,000 degrees so it only takes the pizza 90 seconds to cook and my order would be ready in 5 minutes I should have hung up the phone! by the time I got it home it was rubbery. (Is that a word?) Anyway, Yuck! We won\\'t be back.Omg ! It was not good at all I usually don\\'t give horrible reviews but my father got sick from the vermicelli seafood soup! The seafood was not fresh and was going bad !!!! My pho the soup base was alright but the meat was getting stenchy and you k ow it was getting rotten !!I took my daughter to see Dr Lederman in the Glendale office as she was needing a shoulder replacement. I was told he is the best. My daughter has multiple disabilities from a TBI. She only has the use of that one arm/shoulder. Of course the doctor knew her condition at the first appointment. He said she was too young for a replacement as they only last so long and wanted to put off the surgery. He suggested a series of  shots in the shoulder which did not relieve the pain. Then the next appointment with Dr Lederman a couple years later due to increasing pain, my daughter was sent to a pain clinic again saying she was too young for the surgery and rehab would be hard. Shots in the shoulder and neck did not relieve the pain. Then she was prescribed with pain meds. This went on another few years. She was crying in pain everyday and in the night too. I massaged her up to ten times a day and bought every pain topical solution I could find besides taking the pain meds. She cried and  \"begged\" me to cut off her arm several times. We finally went back to Lederman again. This time my daughter refused to take no for an answer...she wanted the surgery. Dr Lederman left the room and came back in saying \"I\\'m not the man for job. Myself or my staff is not accustomed to working with someone with a TBI.\" Then he walked out. Like he did not already know her condition from day one. My daughter suffered terribly for these years of delaying the surgery then refusing to do it. He did refer us to another doctor who turned out to be a blessing with a very caring heart. Dr Dana Seltzer. The surgery WAS difficult and the rehab WAS difficult, but we got through it as a team and she is now pain free with most of her shoulder movement intact.Denny\\'s food at Beverly Hills prices. \\n\\nOne star is for the decor not the food. \\n\\nWorst eggs Benedict I have had in my entire life. Bacon is dry. Hollandaise sauce is tasteless and bland. Same for my other half. \\nBelgian Waffle saggy. Whipped cream from 99 cent store. Maple syrup is liquid sugar with water. \\nVery  dissaiponting breakfast !!!Not great. Food was stodgy and fairly tasteless, and some dishes were cold. Can\\'t really ask for too much out of a lunch buffet but surely tasting of something ought to be the first thing one aims for in food.  Save your calories for something else.Hands down worst gluten free cupcake I\\'ve ever had. I cannot believe anyone would associate that product with their name, it was terrible.  Not only are all the other bakery\\'s gluten free cupcakes superior to this one, but so are the grocery store box mixes like the gluten free Betty Crocker or Pilsburry. This was the first time I\\'ve ever thrown away dessert half-way through, I always finish or save it for later. The vanilla flavor wasn\\'t the problem. It was so dry, that I had to take a sip of water with each bite because it would get stuck in my throat. If you\\'re at Fashion Square and craving a gluten free treat, do yourself a favor and go to the Macaroon place. I\\'m disappointed, especially considering the cupcake was $5 after tax. The one star is for gluten free cupcakes only, as I have not (and cannot) try a regular one.I went in to have car detailed and they told me it would take an hour, as I was walking away the attendant said oh, maybe an hour and a half. So after an hour and 15 minutes I asked for a status update and they told me another hour!  They have you held captive because they are only part done with each piece. I quit going to them for oil changes for this very reason...unable to deliver as promised. Won\\'t be going back for anything except my floor mats which they didn\\'t get put back.first off i called and the guy barley spoke any english then i had ordered a pizza and had decided to cancel so 2 minutes later i called and canceled but they still charged my credit card so i called and ask for a refund and they pretty much told me too bad so beware of this and i would suggest romas pizza very good and family ownedAs a Mexican born and raised in California I\\'m sorry this place was horrible!! The chili had a strange taste !! We just threw it away! And bought hamburgers from B K and that says a lot!! Don\\'t waste your time!!! \\nIt could have been an off day for them!! \\nAnyways as we ordered through the Drive thru I was practically yelling thinking Omgosh really!! \\nNever again!! \\n\\nIf you try it let me know if you like it ok lolNot a fan. Overpriced, over cooked bland burgers. Everything is extra (fries, onion rings).Did a BOGO for Samsung Galaxy S9 in April 2018. Arranged for in-store pick up. \\n\\nGot the phone, paid off my old one and closed a tablet line. All was good and my bill should of went down $10! \\n\\nTwo months later my bill went up $60. Called Verizon, said it was stores mess up. Called Store they put me back on the call center. \\n\\nGot the call center to submit a form 3x to fix the promotion and was denied for various reasons, the final one being the account was past due because they charge me extra per month.  \\n\\nI have paid it all off AGAIN and filed a BBB complaint. I don\\'t care if the call center or the store fixes it, It just needs to be done right. I have been a customer for over 10 years this is not a way to treat a long standing client.As convenience stores go, this one could be the poster child for what is wrong with the concept.  While the need for procurement of gas is a subject for another forum, the food options are fair game.  Or in this case, more like not fair and lame.Sucks. I\\'m there trying to buy texture for paint and four guys in that department are all busy bullshitting, except for the black man that is there to work and help people. Also, I bought a toilet a month ago and they said someone would contact me in two days. A little over two weeks after my son and I ended up installing it they called. One star because I had too.I will never rent from Budget Rent A Car, again.  I got totally ripped off by their employee at the Phoenix Airport location on 5/3/18.  He added the fuel surcharge of $40+ to my bill, despite specifically being told I didn\\'t want that, I would fill the car up with gas myself before returning the car.  He also told me insurance would be $30, not specifying that it would be $30 + taxes for each day I had the car.  When I asked how my $61 booking (on Costco) became a $200+ rental, he told me \"Arizona has a lot of taxes\".  Given that it took so long to wait and then for him to prepare the contract, I did not read everything---I had my 87 year old father in a wheelchair with me.  When I complained to Budget later, I was told, sorry, you signed the contract.  Shady, shady business.I will never rented from them.\\nMy friend lost the key in the car and we were locked out of the car.\\nI called them but they let us wait for 2 hours and just transfer a key company.\\nThat company required us a annual fee for one time unlocked.\\nFinally, we ended up to talk hotel and they called a local key company.\\n\\nAlso, we made reservation a middle car for $120, but last day, they required $210 which include insurance.\\nEven when I called for unlocking key, they said we do not have insurance.\\nBe careful about total fee and I do not recommend ask them to rent a car.I went in to sell 3 nice old pieces of clothing. They told me after a few hours that they were too stocked up on those specific types of garments. I was asked if I would like to \"donate\" them instead. To which I asked where they will be donated. She said the salvation army, with her arms crossed, looking me straight in the eye (both obvious signs of defense and lying) . I gave her the thumbs up shot a smile and left. I don\\'t really trust them\\nNot sure, but I feel like they are shady and maybe corrupt. I will probably never go there again. My clothes are actually going to the salvation army next time.Went to get a cup of coffee and some breakfast. I expected to wait in a long line, but after waiting for over 15 minutes in the drive thru I finally make it up to place my order. The lady was very rude. I asked for almond milk, she said they\\'re out. I asked for soy, she got loud with me said said WE. ARE. OUT. OF EVERYTHING. \\n\\nShe could have found a nicer approach instead of yelling at me. I got to the window to pay for what I was able to order and she told me that if I wanted my food I would need to come inside and leave my dog in the car because it was unsanitary for me to have my 3 lbs yorkie in my lap while she was handling food. \\n\\nI never heard of anything more stupid in my life. I won\\'t be going back thereEverything we ordered was completely disgusting. We ordered from the late night menu, I got the veggie fajitas beans and rice. They left out my tortillas in my Togo order the beans and rice were disgusting. My best friend ordered the fish tacos which ended up being some sort of strange shredded fish. My boyfriend got the salmon salad, which was ok but would\\'ve been better but the salmon was dry. They left out my garlic fries and on top of all of this disgusting food it was 91$!!! I will never eat here ever againSo I chose this place because they were open at the time I wanted to go pick up dinner at 4pm.  Ordered a Papaya salad and Pad Thai. They asked how I wanted it Mild Medium or Hot.  I stayed safe and said mild for both.  Well, when I got home and opened up the containers--of which they stupidly put them in one bag-dumb because papaya salad is always cold- I had to remove it in the car before heading home.  The Papaya salad was not evenly cut...their shredder is not working and it is supposed to be picked up like speghetti...this was clumps of papaya shredded half way. ALL I COULD TASTE WAS ONION. ONION...like eating a clumpy mouthful of ONION.  Horrid.  The Pad Thai had dry pieces of chicken and ZERO seasoning.  AWFUL. CRAP.  Waste of $17. NEVER BE BACK. They cannot produce Thai food that is worthy.  Instead of driving back to the place to return this...I\\'m writing this review. STAY AWAY.  Should have gone to Thai Plates or tried another place..these guys were the only ones open at the time I wanted food.  BAD DECISION. STAY AWAY. Headed to the fridge to eat crackers and cheese. TICKED.So Mary and her husband came out and assembled a few pieces. Some large, some small. All in all they did a very good job and were polite. I think that we extended the same courtesy. We actually asked them to come back and do another small job. We needed fixtures attached to all our cabinets and drawers. Mary quoted me a price, which I accepted and we agreed on a date. On the day they were suppose to come out, about an hour before our scheduled time, Mary texted and told me her husband had a flat tire and that they\\'d be late. I told her, no problem. I was ok. Then......SILENCE. Never heard back from her again. I texted a few more times to reschedule, I asked her if everything was alright, I even asked if they were OK? I know Mary got my messages because I had gotten read receipts. She just completely ignored me. It was all very strange. So, for the work they did I\\'d rate them a four but for the appointment cancellation and non responsiveness Id give them  a zero if I could. Stephen W. said \" They\\'re real pros\" I beg to differ. Professionals who own and run their business should always respond to it\\'s customers.Service was great. The food was disgusting. Ordered clam chowder and it was barely warm. Then ordered fried shrimp and the shrimp was not deveined. Seriously?! I\\'m paying $18.99 for fried shrimp with the poop vein still intact?! Ugh. Also ordered plain iced tea and it was frothy and super bitter. Definitely not at all impressed and won\\'t be returning.My wife and I flew out to Vegas for the 3-Day President\\'s Day weekend and my 50th birthday.\\nI reserved the car on-line at Hertz a few days earlier: A Mercedes C-Class from the prestige collection. I selected the Reserve This Exact Model option so that we would get a Mercedes.  I also signed up for the Hertz Gold membership so that our car would be ready for us and we would be able to skip the usually long counter lines at the McCarran Airport.  \\nNone of these things happened. \\nOur reservation was for 3:00.  At 2:48 I received an email confirmation that my car was ready for me and even given a stall # to find the car and license plate # to identify the car and even the color-white.  When we got to the stall there was a car, but not the car I had reserved and received confirmation for.  So, I explain my situation to a couple of workers that were walking by and they tell me that there was a Mercedes there earlier but somebody else got it.  Somebody else got it?  It was in a stall reserved for me, right?\\nOk, over to the office to STAND IN LINE anyway.  The counter worker tells me there are no Mercedes available.  I say I reserved one specifically (Choose Exact Model), one was supposedly waiting for me, and I had received an email telling me this.\\nHe tells me he has a better car for me:  A Cadillac.  We go out to see the Cad and I see a Mercedes, a white one, and I ask for it.  He tells me it\\'s held for someone.  I say Yah, me.  He says he can\\'t do it.  I ask why not.  He says it\\'s on hold for someone else.\\nI ask why the car I had on hold went to someone else and he could not explain it.\\nWe look at the Cad and he tells me there are two to choose from and I would like it better than the Mercedes anyway.  Is that why there were 2 Cadillacs and 0 Mercedes available?\\nAnyway, I agreed to take the Cadillac but was left wondering what is so great about Hertz and their Gold Club?  I had to wait in line, I did not get the car I reserved and was PROMISED.\\nTime to start shopping around for a new rental car company.i have ordered from here 5 times. each time a different sandwich. greasy soaked texas style toast and bland as ever. they could have put anything on it to be honest, it tasted like hot grease. perfect for those who like indigestion and stomach pain. over-hyped restaurant, not worth the visit.No stars.. yes no stars... (the app made me select one to post) the complete bs I just witnessed as a customer left me with a real stale taste in my mouth. This is the first dine in experience where the stale taste wasn\\'t caused by the food. I went with my family to this location for lunch. The place was busy which is exactly what any good store manager would want; however a good store manager would also want their customers leaving there location feeling respected, valued, & fully satisfied with their dine in experience. Our experience started out great but it slowly showed signs that it was headed down hill when our burgers came to the table before our salads and shakes. We usually frequent the Parmatown location. They seem so much more professional. When our shakes were delivered to the table the chocolate shake made it to the table but the strawberry banana shake was poured into my wifes lap. As you can imagine this feels great in an air conditioned room while wearing shorts. The shake poured straight down my wifes bare leg into her shoe and onto the floor. My wife received a borage of \"I\\'m sorry!\"s which is awesome and conveys how the workers were feeling at the time. The most important question or worry during this situation is #1 How does the customer feel? #2 How can we help them? #3 What can we do to rectify the situation? In retrospect all we received was late food, apologies, wet pants, napkins, and a bill to pay for it all. Yes a bill! The manager came over attempting to offer apologies and a mop. Not once did she offer a solution to rectify my wifes ruined clothes and meal. I as her husband had to speak up and ask for some type of resolution. Some people have the knack to be a store manager while others just don\\'t. This type of manager is what I commonly refer to as a floater. Floaters are managers who do just enough to maintain current numbers and current status quo. They really have no talent or abilities which are beneficial to improving the overall profitability or running of the store. When this location implements points #1,#2, &#3 they will be taking a step in the right direction. It is needless to say that we won\\'t be back anytime soon nor recommending it.We just recently purchased a house with a pool. Being first time home and pool owners we want to make sure we are doing it correctly. I\\'ve taken my water to be tested here multiple times and each time they act as if it\\'s a great inconvenience for them to spend a minute testing the water. \\n\\nCustomer service seems severely lacking and often feels like they just want you to leave when you walk in. They don\\'t greet you as enter and give half hearted answers to your questions. If you\\'re looking for good service and knowledge please avoid this place. I for one will be looking for a new pool supply store.OMG, Longhitano\\'s is absolutely disgusting! I\\'ve had more satisfactory meals from Arby\\'s than this over hyped pos. Our server was polite but a bit...ditsy & didn\\'t understand the questions we asked or reply with the correct response. I ordered their Alfredo- it smelled & looked terrible upon arrival but I forced myself to at least try it. Huge mistake! When I stabbed it with my fork it was one big massive clump that tasted like it was held together with elmers glue & watered down flour. Although it was luke warm @ best on the surface, it was cold underneath. Even the poor attempt @ garlic bread was laughable. Someone smeared butter on toast & sprinkled too much  garlic salt on it. It\\'s pretty damn bad when Olive Garden\\'s food is more tolerable than this inedible crap. \\n Our friend ordered their The Biggest Haja Steak Sandwich, this should\\'ve been called \"The Biggest Hard Turd Sandwich\" if they wanted to provide a more accurate description. When he bit into it, he literally could not tear one piece off because it was so tough & rubbery. He tried  sawing at it & the knife didn\\'t even make a dent. When Mike stopped to ask us how everything was, Nate expressed how terrible the meat on the sandwich was @ Mike stood their as if he didn\\'t comprehend a word that was said to him. In fact, he kept cutting Nate off & saying \" So it\\'s okay\". Naturally, Nate was irritated & said \" NO! I can\\'t eat this\" & Mike still didn\\'t get it & kept talking over him. Then he walked away...he never apologized nor offered to get Nate something else to eat. He didn\\'t remove the cost from our bill, nothing! When Nate complained to our server he didn\\'t understand either so the nasty sandwich sat there. Our server also saw that my pasta was left untouched but never asked if something was wrong. I get this kid was clearly new to the food service industry but seriously -WTF!?!  \\n My husband had also ordered a drink from the bar when we first sat down, it took our server over 15 minutes to grab it from the bar. Nate had requested a rootbeer, not only did it take over 30 minutes but our server brought out a rootbeer float & charged us extra for the ice cream! Normally I wouldn\\'t suggest this but since the staff was ignoring our complaints, the food wasn\\'t even edible & our patience was gone; I was tempted to leave without paying. \\n Finally, a seasoned waitress noticed our displeasure & offered to remove Nates sandwich from our receipt. However, she only took 15% off of my alfredo & removed the charge for ice cream but charged us for 2 rootbeers when we only ordered 1. She then explained that all of their staff quit @ the same time & all the new hires are \"green\". This is still unacceptable & I don\\'t feel that anyone there is competent. Longhitano\\'s is hands down the second worst meal I\\'ve had this year!I recently moved to Aurora from Texas and I always get my nails done every 2-3 weeks. I walked in into this nail salon as it\\'s near to where I\\'ll be staying to talk to the people in there to explain to them how I get my nails done   and to see if I could make an appointment for the next day. \\n1. When I walked in no one acknowledged me\\n2. A guy asked me to walk over to him to talk to him. I thought that was rude because I personally wouldn\\'t want anyone inquiring about their nails whilst I\\'m getting mine done. He could have excused himself or told me to wait for a few minutes so he could talk to me.\\n3. When I told him I had a picture and wanted to show him if what I wanted done was something he could do, he rudely said \"well we have over 250 nail polishes, you can see if we have those colors.\" Like really?\\nI then politely asked him if he could replicate the picture I had to which he rudely responded \"probably not\" no eye contact, no regard of me whatsoever.  Needles to say I walked out thinking how rude! I will NEVER set foot in this establishment to spend my money in there. \\nVery poor first impression. Extremely rude guy I spoke to. First impressions are everything to me and to most customers. Don\\'t go there unless if you want to be treated like a second class citizen.I tried to treat myself for going to a four-star hotel but it seemed they were holding back on basic amenities and proper service unless you would buy into all the atrocious add-ons that they suggested. No breakfast, no wifi, and when I got into my room all my lamps, TV, phone, etc. were either plugged off or on a timer so that they could save money on electricity. I found this out because I wanted to call guest services to let them know the TV wasn\\'t working, and realized in short succession that the phones weren\\'t working either. That\\'s not just an inconvenience, it\\'s a safety hazard!\\nI had to ride the elevator and walk into the lobby with my slippers, with people glancing at me. I had to stay that way for a LONG TIME, given that I could not find a single person to help me in that big hotel. I ended up having to walk outside to the streets, where I finally got a valet to go inside, call a manager, and waited out my final few minutes while she finally found some time for me. \\nFour star hotel. Really? Nice place, clean sheets, but unfortunately an unpleasant experience.\\nGreat location though.Okay, I know this is supposed to be the \"cheap\" restaurant in the Wynn, but we\\'re still talking about $18 burgers for lunch, so cheap is relative.  We waited 35 minutes for our food, and of course they got our order wrong.  Did I mention that the place is like half full.  Good thing it wasn\\'t busier, then we might wait an hour for the wrong order.\\n\\nThey of course add 18% for parties of 6 or more so great!  I get to way overpay for the wrong food.  I got lazy and didn\\'t want to leave the resort.  Bad call there.Bad staff...staff was not welcoming at all . I checked in online for my two boys and within 5 mins we were at great clips . On screen we were shown the first to get haircut , however they took other in . When I asked why is that -staff with raised voice this is how it works and you r next -I waited for next one and again they repeated same taking other in before us . With raised tone and bad . I left with my 2boys from there without getting haircut . Will not go again . Bad bad staff....they do not have a curtesy to talk to a customer .\\n\\nWorst staffWhen there are SO MANY other choices, why shop from a place that has ZERO customer service and follow up.   This company is run by an absolute A*****E.. \\n\\nThey sold me a \"Kamado Rocket\" which is a beautiful piece of art, but does not work due to terrible metal work, and they have no intention of fixing their $3,000 POS.\\n\\nDO NOT, I repeat DO NOT do business with this company.They say they are open until 7pm.  It\\'s is 615pm and the guy inside says they are closed.   Won\\'t be wasting my gas to come here again.  THEY CLOSE EARLY!What a Shock!\\n\\nHad Philly Cheese Steaks coast to coast including Philly.  In 55 years of enjoying sandwiches;  This Gilbert Geno\\'s has the distintion of being one of the worst sandwiches I have had.  I got a large on an OK bread with a small serving mix of goo that reminded me of Manwich out of a can.  Or Cincinnati Chili.   Either way, putting the Geno\\'s name on it would make Joey Vento roll in his graveThe last time I gave this place a try, the food sucked and I gave it 2 Stars.  On a recent Vegas trip my flight was at a gate nearby and I decided to give them another chance.  \\n\\nThis time around, the food still sucked, but the employees are even worse.  Here\\'s what happened....I ordered the following items:\\n\\nBean, Rice, Cheese Burrito $6.99\\nBottle of Diet Pepsi $3.19\\n\\nSince I had a backpack and other stuff in my hand, I forgot the bottle of Diet Pepsi at the counter after I paid for the meal.  I went to the counter to get settled in a spot to eat and get napkins, utensils, etc.  5 minutes later, they called my number for my Burrito....I was starving, so I started to eat it.  After a few bites, I noticed that I didn\\'t have my soda....where was it?  I looked around, went back to the counter.....the employees looked at me but didn\\'t say anything.  I walked around again looking for it....then I said to the girl cashier \"I think I left my Soda somewhere, have you seen it?\"  She said \"No\" then looked at one of the guys and said something in Spanish to him.  He said, \"Oh, I think I have it.  I found it on the counter\".  I watched as he reached into his backpack and gave it back to me.....WTF?!  I think they do this all the time, watch for people to leave stuff behind and then take it.  The appalling thing is that I was still in the restaurant!  \\n\\nI didn\\'t say anything to them...it would\\'ve done no good anyway.  Once a thief, always a thief.\\n\\nThat does it for me, I will never eat here again.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 0%Not so good. Extremely slow service.  Chicken not very tasty. Instant mashed potatoes. Gravy no flavor.  As we were eating there were 15 people waiting in line for service.  Pretty expensive for what you get.  We wont be back.Buyer beware!!! If you buy a car from this place\\nThey sell it to you as is. Meaning they don\\'t inspect the vehichles for mechanical issues. My girlfriend purchased a car 3 weeks ago Ned\\'s new tires oil pan is stripped out and leaking oil, cv boot is ripped, cam seals are leaking. They gave her a 1 month warranty from Edmonds that was completely worthless, the denied her claim. She drove the car back to cali and has had issues ever sinceHorrible service. They took the orders of people who came in after me.  Then they served people who ordered after me.  I felt like they ignored me because I was on my own. I waited for over 30 minuted then they said the kitchen messed up.  If you are going to keep your customers happy , hire more staff that know what they are doing.Honestly the looks the girls give my fiancé and myself when we come in for each appointment is disgusting, to feel judged and looked at a certain way for absolutely no reason bugs me to no end, they don\\'t know my life they don\\'t know her life they don\\'t know our ages or one single thing about either of us, to add on to that we have had 3 reschedules for 2 appointments now, 2 reschedules for one single appointment in which we were pushed out one week further and again one week further until they got their stuff figured out and can successfully schedule a consistent appointment schedule, we had our first ultrasound today and the woman who did the ultrasound was just an angry woman in which you are putting your trust in to measure and check your babies health and anatomy, she was rude to my fiancé when my fiancé was asking one simple question she replied with I need to focus right now, just let me do these measurements, to add to this whole ordeal, the environment of this office is just not good at all, who watches murder shows on TV with children present in the lobby and blood and gore all over the screen? We were anxiously anticipating an answer on the blood work we did from our last appointment and was not given a single answer and why you ask? Because they showed that we missed our appointment to get it done and we were told that we needed to get it done ASAP, well if you guys actually communicated to the lab office and did your paperwork correctly you would have seen that we went in a did do the lab work just as you told us to do so, we do our part as parents and are consistent with our things in life, don\\'t try to blame us for missing an appointment to get the most important lab work done, which was testing for Down syndrome and other birth defects, would have really loved to know the results to the blood work for our first child. Thanks! One last thing, to the girl who has the short black hair at the front desk and the dermal on her neck who keeps giving myself and my fiancé dirty looks, if you don\\'t like what you do then get a different job and quit staring you may be unhappy but don\\'t make everyone\\'s life as miserable as yours, all of these reviews speak for themselves I would suggest going somewhere else, ANYWHERE else than this place, I would avoid this place at all costs, save yourself the headaches and anger from the disrespectful girls at the front deskSo... arrived at ~5:30 and sat outside... ordered by 5:35... then we waited... and waited... and waited. No one checked on us (2 people) until 6:15. At that point, we asked for our food to go. Got that and the checks at 6:20. Finally able to pay and leave by 6:30.\\nProbably some of  the worst service I have received. At least if you are running behind or food is taking awhile, you come back and explain and/or apologize. Instead, we were left wondering and waiting for our food. Obviously that never came until we said we were going to leave and take it with us. You would think at that point they would have apologized or taken something off the check, but no, nothing.\\nChances are, I won\\'t be back. That is unfortunate, as we spend a lot of time in the area and this would have been a great outdoor spot!\\nTo top it off, when I got home and opened the soggy boxes, I was very disappointed at what I paid $11 for.Food is average. Service is mostly good. \\n\\nTried almost every breakfast plate as well as the burgers.\\n\\nLook elsewhere for good eats.Bought my gear there for years, and did so up until the long haired hippy guy looked at me the minute I walked in and said rudely, \" take of your backpack and leave it up front\". Seriously, really. The amount of time it takes to take that off and put it on, takes forever. Am I really going to shove something into a backpack that\\'s fastened to my back? No other stores have ever asked me to remove my backpack ever, specially some hippy long haired ass wipe. You guys went down hill fast. NEVER, ABSOLUTELY NEVER WILL I STEP ONE FOOT INSIDE YOUR STORE AS LONG AS I BREATH AIR. Oh, and BTW, I went that day and bought my helmet of decent people, AZMotorsports. Yeah it was more expensive, but they were polite, and they actually knew about the products. Perhaps the high turnover in staff is a hint of a deeper lying issue. Keep your BILT crap, and your crappy service from long haired hippy morons!Walked out of the place without even being acknowledged by the staff while they were talking with each other. We were completely igHmmmm. Well we waited forever to get our food. Not sure if it\\'s any good but after an hour wait on a not so busy day, the only activity we saw that was quick was getting our check after we complained about the wait. What a shame. \\n\\nDoubt I will be back. Service was awful.\\n\\nStill can\\'t believe the manager allowed us to walk out of there without trying to make amends.They don\\'t even deserve a single star but their was no other choice.\\n\\nStay far away from this unethical company if you can avoid it.  \\n\\nThe only reason why I\\'ve been forced to stay with them this long is because they are the only business internet service provider in Boulder City, NV.  I\\'m sorry to say I\\'ve been a customer for over 4 years but I\\'m completely dissatisfied.\\n\\nThey engage in fraudulent bait and switch billing tactics after agreeing to a new two year (lower rate) service agreement, my bill has practically doubled instead of going down each month for three consecutive months now.  \\n\\nNothing but a sham.  Every time you contact them, you get lost in a quagmire of confusion and disinformation and not to mention the worst customer service I\\'ve ever seen.  Some of these people and I\\'m talking about management are not able to diffuse an escalating issue and only add more fuel to the fire.\\n\\nThe company needs to be rebuilt from the top on down.  Horrible!!!I had to give them a one star cause there is nothing less then one star.  A group of 9 wanted a nice last meal nothing came even warm to the table after waiting an hour to receive it.  Scallops where not even cooked, baked potatoe was cold, steak was room temperature, and after the reviews we wanted lobster mac and cheese there was no lobster in it at all and we had 3 of them.  Broccoli Raab was a few steamed frozen broccoli crowns that was sent immediate back.  They made 18% gratuity and did a lousy job I\\'m sitting here writing this as I\\'m waiting for my check because they are so slow.  Go anywhere but here, especially if you want a nice meal like we did.The security was awful. My friend was kicked in the back by a group of girls and we were asked to leave. Do not go here. It is all trash.This used to be one of my favorite restaurants but the quality has dropped precipitously. The food is no longer anything special, and the service can be downright hostile. The last two times we\\'ve eaten here, our server (older middle-aged woman wearing way too much perfume) was very rude. Most recently, she made us wait 10 minutes before she came to our table, even though we were the only ones in the restaurant! \\n\\nShe asked if we wanted menus (who asks that question?), then literally fewer than 3 seconds later, asked if we were ready to order. I could feel the animosity radiating from her. We tipped less than 10%, and this still was overly generous. I used to be a waiter, and have only tipped less than 20% in 2 restaurant visits - this is out of probably thousands of visits. \\n\\nThe food is now bland and tastes like fast food Chinese. Even the chicken coconut soup doesn\\'t taste right, and that was their best dish. \\n\\nIt\\'s a damn shame; this used to be one of my favorite restaurants. I\\'m guessing it was bought by somebody who simply doesn\\'t care, and that attitude is reflected by the staff. \\n\\nThe good ratings here are probably remnants of old visits - I would stay far, far away from this restaurant.How do they have people being nominated for MVP when: 1) Their team has a losing record? and 2) The same kids do not make the All-Star team? Coaches kids or something???WOW!  That\\'s all I have to say.  Not sure what happened since the last time I was here, but it was like going to a completely different restaurant.  Horrible, rude service from BOTH of the waitresses, not just from the one that all the other people here have mentioned--tall, nasty, and always has a look on her face like someone just took a crap in her cereal.  And I sort of got the impression that because I am gaijin (ie: not Japanese) I may have pissed them off even more.  Food still tasted the same (great) but the ambiance and the attitude really, REALLY rubbed me the wrong way.  Needless to say--no tip.  I would have RELISHED the opportunity that the other reviewer had when tall and nasty followed you out to the parking lot and demanded a tip--I guarantee she wouldn\\'t have found that to be a pleasant experience.  You all just lost a customer and a fan--congratulations nasty face!!!I would give them a zero if I could. They talked me into other services, my fault for being naive and trusting. He was a fast talker, and as soon as I agreed to those other services, they packed up and left. Didn\\'t even do the work. Very shady and I DO NOT RECOMMEND.Terrible and expensive experience both times. First one was a year ago, when I requested the parts fellow to order me a new muffler. He said it would be in, in about 3 days. 5 days later I called, and he forgot to order it. 10 days later, I called them again, and they still forgot to order it, despite me being in front of the counter. \\nSecond situation was on Nov. 4 th, 2017. My 1998 Rav 4 was not carrying a charge despite me purchasing a new battery, the evening before. On that cold and snowy day, my wife and I broke down on 130th Ave S.E. . I managed to get the vehicle as far as the Safeway Parking lot, where we were stranded. I called the Canadian tire across the street and spoke to the manager. He told me to bring it right in. Well, we called a tow truck and waited for 2 and a half hours. No biggy there as it was a busy day for them as one could imagine. We brought the vehicle in on a large flat bead truck. I asked the mechanic, where did he want it; and he said anywhere. Once we dropped it; I went inside and spoke to Ron about the problems. Ron was a super nice guy. Very friendly. I mentioned to him, that there was a loose + positive cable clamp that had to be tightened. I needed to have the alternator checked as the new battery died on us . \"After the repairs are completed Ron, could you please have them do a safety check on the vehicle please?\" Here came the upsell. \" Well, he said, we have 3 different types of safety checks. Then he felt a pressing need to tell me all about them and their respective prices. I cut him off short, and instructed him to provide me with the cheapest (100.00) safety check. \\nHere in point form, were the blunders that were committed. \\n1. Ron got my name wrong, my sex wrong, and all this with me standing in front of him and correcting him as he put an entirely different name on the key tag. I corrected him and even called back to ensure that the information on the work order was complete; but he didn\\'t even bother to put down the much needed information. That\\'s just plain unprofessional. \\n2. I spoke to him about purchasing a new battery, just the night before, and that my + cable clamp was not tight. Despite this, he didn\\'t bother to put any of this on the work order. \\n3. Never informed me of the labor costs, part costs if it was a alternator and so forth\\n4.Never mentioned on the work order that the vehicle died while driving; but instead, said that it just stalled. \\n5. The assistant manager \" Dennis\" called and left a message for me, that the Rav would not pass a safety test because that battery is not working, and a headlight bulb was out. (Well of course....why do you think it was there?) \\n6. The assistant manager called me a second time at my residence later the next day; and informed me that my alternator would need replacing despite it being purchased new from one year previous. I asked him how much the alternator was and he gave me a rough cost. Then he said I would be charged. 1.2 ( which I guess was one hour and twenty minutes) for the labour. Fair enough I said, go ahead with the repair. At this point I figured;, it will be about 5 hundred dollars by the time they soak me for everything. \\n7. Later that day I picked up the vehicle and it was way over and above at $683.00. When asked to explain the costs...they said they were too busy. \\n8. When I arrived home, I looked at the invoice and noticed that they hadn\\'t even taken the time to fill out the top of the safety check. Truth be known, they never probably checked a thing. No name, no policy number, no make model or year of the vehicle, no Vin number, no date...absolutely nothing!\\n9. Shop supplies was 35 dollars and some change. There are only two bolts that secure an alternator to it\\'s bracket. Tell me where were there 35 worth there? \\n10. The assistant manager couldn\\'t provide me ( their customer) with the proper warrantee period for it, nor did he know how long safety checks are good for. \\n** Now after all that, does this sound like a professional service to you? They should be ashamed for treating customer\\'s this way. \\nNeedless to say; I won\\'t be back for any service. They are reckless and unprofessional.I spent 45 minutes in this store shopping for my babies and our home.  Got to the check out counter and unloaded my order.  The cashier started checking me out and then called another cashier over and she told me Target stores were on probation and could no longer take WIC.  There is not one sign posted anywhere to this in the store or on the front window of the store.  The isles still have the WIC symbols on them.  The cashier said she could call the front manager and I told her what good was it going to do if they don\\'t take WIC.  I left a full cart with her and told her I had to go elsewhere now. \\nWhen I got home I called the corporate office and put in a complaint.  The person I spoke with had no knowledge of this but took my name and said he was going to look into the matter and advised me to call the manager at the store.\\nI called the manager at the store and the only thing he could be bothered to tell me was they used to take WIC but don\\'t any longer.  I told him there were no signs posted to that and that the shelves still had the WIC stickers on them.  His answer to me was that there was no sign on the front window saying they took WIC.  I also told him I spoke with some employees regarding something I was looking for and they saw the WIC checks in my hand and never said anything.\\nThis store is taking up space.  I have gone there numerous times on a Sunday for milk and eggs only to find they were totally out of whole milk and eggs.  Please who is doing the ordering.  I will continue to shop at Walmart even though this store is only a mile away from me.  The manager never even said he was sorry, only had excuses, I hung up.I go to this market some time. The good thing is that they open until 12 am so I can stop by this place late night. The bad thing is that those hispanic workers are very unprofessional.  I do speak Spanish and understand what they are saying in Spanish inside the store. My experience today was the worst... Three of Mexican workers were using nasty cursing words in front of the customers assuming that no one understood what they were saying, such as \"puta(Bitch or whore)\\' or \"chingado(F--- u).\" Those are extremely nasty & disrespectful cursing words and I was totally grossed out. I told them that they shouldn\\'t use those nasty words in front of the customers then one of them joked, \"Puta means pretty in Korean.\" Of course not.. That really insults Koreans and their culture. I was totally disappointed in their unprofessional act and attitude and would like to stay away from this store for a while. It doesn\\'t matter what language they speak, but they should NEVER use disrespectful cursing words in front of the customers. End of the line.if i could give a 0 star i would...\\n\\nso my husband and i decided to try the Clicklist function of order online and pick up groceries curbside. we arrived at 7:01 pm and watched for well over 10 minutes through the glass at the associate that was manning the station took cell phone calls, cut paper with scissors, took a selfie and what not before my husband went into the store proper to ask about getting our order. well after a minute after returning to the car after talking to customer service we decided to film said associate. she took another call and what not and we have well over 4 minutes of footage of her doing nothing. at this point we hit the 20 minute mark of waiting and my husband went back into the store where he was met by the cs employee and the manager. they called the associate up and she admired she\\'d taken some calls and told us we should have called her to let her know we were there. the websites specifically states to stay in your car as they come out to you and no phone number or instructions to call are issued in the confirming email i received. the manager didn\\'t even apologize for her employee or try to make amends just assured my husband our card hadn\\'t been charged as of yet so we canceled the order. we went to the smiths on sahara and nellis our normal store which doesn\\'t have the Clicklist feature. i told them what happened and they gave us the office number to the area and we will be calling them as well as submitting screen shots of my confirming email, my order confirmation number and the 4 plus minutes of video to their corporate email. \\n\\ngood luck explaining the cell phone usage.Horrible service and communication. Owner was very rude and lacked professionalism even after acknowledging a mistake on his website that lead me to believe I could get a hand wash at 4:45 pm when hours of operation 8:00am -7:00pm. I drove 30 minutes and he didn\\'t seem to care and instead walked away leaving an argumentative employee behind. Too many options in Charlotte to give this place my business.If you enjoy luxuries like electricity and running water, keep looking because you won\\'t find it here. I can\\'t tell you how many days the electric or water has been shut off for hours at a time. If you are looking for a place that will make your home susceptible to robbery, this is the place for you!. A few weeks ago they hired painters to come around and paint all the doors. The painters came in the morning while I was at work and left my door open to let the paint dry while I wasn\\'t home. I came home around 5:30 PM to find the door to my apartment completely wide open. Thankfully nothing was stolen or vandalized but this just goes to show you how inept this complex  and its managers are at running a safe and responsible business. I reported the incident to management and never received any kind of response. My unattended apartment was left wide open for 8+ hours and the management couldn\\'t be bothered to even call or email me about the situation. \\n\\nTo top it off, last weekend I had to call 911 because a half-naked meth addict was trying to break into my car because she \"needed a place to sleep\". 3 cops, a firetruck and an ambulance ended up having to come to deal with the woman. This is the 3rd time in 5 months I have had to call 911 for drug addicts in the parking lot of this complex. \\n\\nLiving here isn\\'t only a horrific experience, it\\'s dangerous. Do. Not. Live. Here. \\n\\nBecause living here has been a complete nightmare, I am moving out a month early. It\\'s not worth living somewhere as dangerous as this.\\n\\nP.S. -- all the 5 star reviews for this place are written by the employees.If I could give zero stars I would. My friend and I came 1/1/17 at 2:15pm (they opened at 2pm) when we arrived the hostess told us it would be a 30-40 minute wait for food because they were busy. We decided that we would stay bc the restaurant was small & the crowd wasn\\'t very large; big mistake. After we were seated it took 10 minutes for our waitress to come over to the table for our drink orders. Then another 20 minutes for her to bring our drinks & take our order. After over an hour my friend was brought her meal; whiting & super cold grits. The waitress said they were putting my wings in now for my chicken & waffles; after over an hour. My friend asked for new grits and after ten minutes she still hadn\\'t received new grits and my food had not come. It was now 4pm & I was over it. We had the waitress cancel our orders. During this extremely long wait for food (of which mine never came) our waitress not once checked on our table. The person next to us canceled his check after waiting so long for food. After paying for my mimosa (given to me in a red wine glass) the waitress did offer my friend and I an expired coupon for 10% off our next visit. I\\'ll pass.Although I have been going to DeFalco\\'s for years, my last visit was a waste. Two orders of side salads were not included in my take out order. So I returned and received them. Only to return home and find out my 4 orders of meatball subs were not even correct. How do you get meatball subs mixed up? SMH. Not worth the drive since I\\'m coming from Mesa for what use to be friendly and exceptional service and correct orders of what I order.The worst place to get your nails done. Rude and obnoxious. 45$ for a pedi and thy forgot the praffin wax at the end. THATS THE WHOLE POINT OF A 45$ pedi.Servers look you in the eye then ignore you when you are the only customer standing at the bar wanting a drink. Incredibly, egregious customer service.They were very manipulative and literally ripped us off. Don\\'t go there because the price is absolutely not worth the food!The most bland tasting Italian food that I have ever had! Unfortunately, the only good thing was the cappacino. Very over priced as well! The food comes out on basically an assembly line with a salad extremely drenched in dressing. Garlic bread was decent. I was very excited to go to this restaurant and it was a major let down for my family. We had linguine and clams,manicotti,and lasagna. Each dish was equally lackluster.Avoid like the plague.We ordered sisig and they told us it would be ready at 12:30. It was let ready till almost 2 pm and we needed it for a birthday party. The lady at cash didn\\'t even care or apologize and was rude. I\\'ll never go back thereWhen this salon opened, they were great.  Over the past few years, ownership/management changes have really led to a decline.  The pedicures I have had there haven\\'t been very good for a while.  I recently found an older gift certificate I had, so I took it in and the lady (who had not one other customer, by the way, laughed when I asked if I could still use it.  She said that they expire a year after the purchase date (which is not noted anywhere on the gift certificate.) \\n\\nAny business should always keep a consistent accounting policy.  Gift certificates outstanding should be noted in the event of a sale and still honored if not disclosed with an expiration as this one was not.  I was there to have several services and they lost an additional $60 above the pedicure value of the gift certificate that they should have honored.  I went down the road to my preferred salon.I have used a few different property management companies and never had such a horrible experience as I did with Paramount. I was having an issue with a non-working hot water heater which required a work order. The work order was put in and assigned to a vendor but the vendor cancelled. It was the day off during the time they should have been at my home. I told the vendor that was unprofessional and unacceptable so I would be contacting my property management. I was not rude just direct. I am a manager in one of the largest corporations so I know all about tone and customer service. Before I could call Paramount they called me. She did not let me speak or explain the issue before she advised me that I was rude and had no right to speak to the vendor that way. I tried to tell her I was not rude and she was not on the phone with us so why would she listen to a vendor over her own tenant. She said because I was a liar and she believed them since she had worked with them before. She continued to speak to me like I was not a paying tenant and yell at me like I was causing the issue. I had to remind her it is Paramounts legal obligation to provide water and hot water since I am the tenant. She said she was going to cancel my work order since I was rude and had issues. I am sorry but no matter how rude (which I wasn\\'t) it is the property managements responsibility to make sure this is fixed. This was 3 days now with no hot water. I tried to explain I had just gotten home from the hospital from major surgery but she disregarded any empathy and continued to yell at me over the phone. I advised her I would be letting the Better Business Bureau know and the local housing agency. In the end, my husband ended up calling and her tone was totally different. She made it sound like I was the one who was irrational and upset but of course my husband believed me not her. She was speaking nicely to him until he advised her that he was my husband and he did not appreciate how she spoke to me. She then reverted back to her old self and had an attitude. He advised her that this is not how things work and it is their legal obligation to make sure this gets taken care of in a timely manner. He also stated he was an Army veteran and he gave her respect so she needed to give him respect and return. She continued to be reckless with her words so he ended the call with stating he would report Paramount to everyone he could. A manager and supervisor were asked for multiple times and she stated she was the person to talk to. We found out later that she was neither and was just an administrative assistant apparently on some type of power trip. I would never recommend this property management company because they treat their tenants like trash and have no sense of what customer service really is.Arrived to spend some time at a bar that looked like it had a decent atmosphere after our flight was cancelled.  However my wife and I were overwhelmed by the number of fruit flies. It was bad just when we were having drinks. When the person next to use ordered some food, it became seriously disgusting. Can\\'t comment on the food because we are going to move on to somewhere else.Here to rent my car, 1 agent 6 people ahead of me. There\\'s no way I\\'m going to make my first appointment\\xa0\\nWould you please learn how to staff a car rental place #1\\n#2 learn how to staff it on Spring Break\\nPlease take advantage car rental off Hotwire\\xa0\\nI did not choose you for this trip, nor will I in the future\\xa0\\nPathetic customer service and pathetic for the lack of respect for your employees\\xa0\\nNow 6 people behind me 25 min later another employee shows upI have been coming here for 3 years and I will say the high turnover rate between the doctors and the reception people is ridiculous. \\nBiggest complaint - not one of the employees acknowledge you. I have to practically sit on the counter for someone to say \"can I help u\" I continue to come here because I have paid off my service and here is where they take care of it. I don\\'t like the saying \"u get what u pay for\" I expected 100% better. \\nIf you don\\'t mind being ignored or talked to like you are completely uneducated then this is the place for u!!!Came in here looking for a lively country bar in Vegas, let me say this is not it. The bartenders and staff are very nice. The atmosphere has more of an older crowd, my friend and I were the only ones doing line dancing. We had an okay time. We asked for a special 9$ jar for both of us and received a bill for 50$! We let it go and went on with our night but even the nicest clubs in vegas are not that much! Added bonus everyon starts leaving around 12 and you yourself will have to leave before 1 or youll be bounced out too!i\\'ve had nothing but bad experiences here. the owner was not very welcoming, never buys any of the clothes i bring in (jcrew, madewell, c.wonder), and always says they\\'re \"backed up\" with their buys. i\\'ve received texts when my \"buy\" was ready, but when i go back to the store, the ladies behind the counter act like no one has even gone through my items. so, then i wait for 10 minutes while they figure it out. here\\'s a suggestion: get a standard process in place and stop wasting your customers\\' time.\\n\\nall of these things wouldn\\'t bother me so much if i didn\\'t see other brands/clothes literally from the early 2000s for sale in the store.\\n\\ni won\\'t be going back.We live near this Denny\\'s and service has been hit or miss so we normally avoid it. I wanted moons over my hammy so we went to Denny\\'s and my husband even expressed his concern. I should have listened. There was one table with 2 people at it, at 9pm at night, that should have told us everything. We stood up front waiting to be seated, there was no one around to seat us. Then a waitress walked through the back and looked at us, I thought for sure she was coming up front. Wrong. She walked back and forth, didn\\'t acknowledge our presence. Then a manager walked into the same area, looked at us and didn\\'t smile, didn\\'t say I\\'ll be right with you, nothing. He turned around and started talking to the girl about some issue in the kitchen. He completely ignored the fact we were there. At that point we left. We went across the street to Village Inn (full parking lot btw). Imagine when walked in we were greeted and told they would be right with us. The manager saw us and immediately went to try and seat us while he was in the middle of something. I\\'m done with the Denny\\'s. You have sealed the deal I won\\'t be back and with the way things looked the restaurant sales won\\'t keep you in business either.I will never recommend this place to anyone. I went in for a miscarriage and had to tell EVERYONE I came in contact with over the course of two appointments that I lost the baby after receiving things like \"are you excited for the new baby?\", \"oh good, the test I took were negative\" & \"you\\'re about this far along so this is what you will see in the ultrasound\" (these were not the only comments and it is obvious no one looks at the files for their patients.) When I went to pay for my second appointment the girl tried to get me on the plan for paying for the birth. I had to decline her 4 times. I still received 2 letters in the mail for the plan of birth including pay by dates. Then the last straw was they charged me close to $3000 for the damn plan and other things that I had already paid out of pocket for. Again, I had a miscarriage. My baby died and I am still receiving and expected to pay for something I WILL NOT HAVE. Every letter from them is a reminder of what my family lost and as much progress as we have made in healing this doctors office sets us back. There is no compassion here. If I could give less than one star I would.I was stationed in Nevada in 2012 and relied heavily on Verizon. Horrible mistake. No service in my dorm or anywhere on that block. I spent $500 on a brand new galaxy s4. After about a year, everything started deteriorating. GPS stopped working, service got worse, and miscellaneous files took up most of the space on my phone.\\n\\nVerizon\\'s fix? Spend $800 om a new phone. An A1C in the USAF makes about $17k their first year, so a new phone was out of the question. I replaced the antennas and restored service, but then It happened again; this time replacing things didn\\'t work. I haven\\'t been able to use my GPS in 4 years. I can\\'t put anymore files/pics/songs on my phone because I have 20 GBs in random files that can\\'t be erased.\\n\\nThe service is unbearable. I went to San Diego with my girlfriend to visit her family. I had a phone interview because I was a few weeks from separating from the mil. There wasn\\'t any service anywhere. I drove around for 45 mins looking for service. Found it, but something malfunctioned and instead of the call going through as I stared at my phone, a voice mail popped up. I tried calling back, but all the bars dropped to zero. This was a nightmare. Ultimately, I didn\\'t get the job, presumably because I hadn\\'t prepared myself for the interview with better service.\\n\\nIt\\'s gotten to the point where I stay at home all the time incase a company calls about a job. It\\'s the only place in las vegas thag I get signal. I don\\'t even get service in the Verizon store.\\n\\nTheir fix? Get a ne phone. Create a problem. Sell a solution. How come my laptop doesn\\'t malfunction because of its age? I use it more than my phone because it\\'s more reliable. The UAVs we flew had data link systems that rarely, if ever, had to be changed.\\n\\nI think Verizon raises attenuation on old phones or somehow disrupts service to force users to buy another phone.\\n\\nEither way, worst service ever. Once I start my new job, we\\'re all getting AT&T.Tiny burger might as well have paid $1 at McDonald\\'s for what I got, Las Vegas has the poorest customer service and quality unless you are on the strip. So sad wish I could get in touch with corporate this is sad AF. So close to California and I\\'m from Texas and it\\'s way better there. Real ice cream shakes my ass, soft serve and tastes artificial, lying to your customers for sure,tasted like trash just threw it away. Negative 5 is more like it, couldn\\'t pay me to eat here.Waste of time and money. After arriving in town to visit family we headed to \"table\" for dinner. I ordered a burger medium well with pepper jack cheese. It arrived well done without cheese.  We had other issues with the 2 of the 4 meals ordered. The waitress was not listening and failed to correctly order one of the fish entrees. 12 bucks for an over cooked burger with a burned slice of cheese was a bit much. Sadly we ended up ordering pizza once we got back to the hotel.  Pretentious, eclectic and disjointed menu coupled with an overpriced and underwhelming food and service.  Enter at your own risk.....Today a guys who work in this subway station said me : The Canada speak only English ! He don\\'t no that his country speak English and French (Ottawa, Québec and Montréal 50% speak French) Please how he can have this work? I am French and I know more about his country than this boy! \\nBad representation of his country!Service was really poor.\\nMay try the King Street one to see if service is better.\\nIt was my first time going and I found the waiter serving us rude and ignorant.\\nWill not go back to this restaurant.I booked a flight online and although my flight has \"cancel or modify\" option online, when I click on it, it tells me to call the airline. The wait time, gasp, is 45 minutes.... I have a full time job. I should be able to cancel a flight online. Last time I called them, I waited almost an hour and it turned out they had me call in because they wanted to sell me some promotional credit card. NOT WORTH THE DISCOUNTS!I have never had an experience at a car repair place where the manager was so laid back and out of touch with the customer. I was getting new pads and rotors on my VW and dropped my car off in the morning on a Saturday. When I dropped it off I was told it would be completed that day. I was told they would call me when it\\'s ready and I told them my son would come pick up the car before they closed at 6. At 4:30, I called for an update and I was abruptly told that they would have to call me back. No big deal. Time goes by, no call back. I call again close to 6 and tell them I need to arrange for my son to pick up the car and ask if its ready. They tell me they don\\'t know when its going to be ready? It\\'s 6 Oclock now and you don\\'t know. He keeps telling me he has to call me back. I tell them that it unacceptable since you close at 6 and my son is on his way. He does not tell me they are going to work late nor does he tell me the car won\\'t be ready till Monday. At this point I am fuming at the lack of consideration and communication. I am being inconvenienced now and no answers. The manager was young and inexperienced and way too laid back to deliver bad news to customers. I would of understood if the situation was explained to me and I wasnt continually told they had to call me back. \\n\\nThis after last week I had to take my sons car back there to get the bottom plastic sheath put back on after falling off while driving after getting an oil change. \\n\\nI will never go to this place again.had to listen to this yeehaw cringe birthday song 3 times in 1 hour. trees trees treesIt started with a long check in, and ended with a sad breakfast of cereal and well past ripe bananas.  In between was an extremely dated building, old furniture, ridiculously slow \"free\" wi-fi, and missing amenities,   I\\'ve stayed at a number of discount hotels, and extended stay facilities.  This was on the lesser end of the spectrum.  \\n\\nThe lone positive was the young man at the front desk who was very friendly, meant well, and in spite of zero support, tried his best to work for you.If you\\'re a guy this is the place to go to get a screwed up haircut. Thank The Lord I always wear a hat cause if the general public saw my haircut they would run away like the Asians run from Godzilla. I never understood why people pay 30-40 bucks for a haircut until I went here. I highly would recommend a Man never go here.Nothing like paying $10+ for a container of curly fry bits and pieces and a sandwich where the bun is actually more greasy that the bacon that was on it.Worst food experience ever.  Avoid this place and spend your hard earned money somewhere else.I\\'ve waited so long in the drive thru line and the worst thing is there was no one even in front of me I\\'ve waited 15 minutes just to order my food at the drive thru....and the food tasted like crap.We waited twenty minutes and never got served... they sat us down in a booth, and we saw them look at us a couple of times but no one came to our section. We really wanted to try it out but no one even asked us for drinks, this place was almost completely empty . We won\\'t be coming back.Too bad I can\\'t give 0 stars... It should not take over 30 mins to get food from a fast food joint. The service is incredible unprofessional and the place is Unorganized. Avoid avoid avoid unless u wanna waste 40 mins of Ur life away being ignored and waiting for cold food.DO NOT BRING YOUR PET HERE!\\n\\nReceptionist is rude and talks down upon you. I asked a question about the medication and pricing and she answered me like I should have known those answers. \\n\\nMedication is OVERPRICED. My cousin was watching over my dogs and needed to take him to the vet. We had to buy my dog eyes drops and felt desperate and bought the eye drops. At my regular vet the eye drops would have been $25 but here they charged $66. Also, a recheck-up should be free at most vets, but they charge a fee here also.\\n\\nDo your research and take your pets somewhere else. You can save money and talk to someone way more polite then them. \\n\\nI don\\'t review places often unless I feel the absolute need too. If i can give them a zero star, I would.Do not eat the GF crust if you have Celiac!!! It\\'s definitely not GF. I usually can deal with a little bit of unavoidable contamination but by my reaction their crust DOES actually contain gluten. Be careful. It\\'s also very pricey given the quality of the actual pizza. Definitely a big NO-NO.After 3 emails and 1 phone call-----still unable to setup a appointment  for a free estimate. Amy is not good for your business.Horrible! No shuttles running. No one at the gate to give directions. I missed my flight because of no service.I ordered large ice cream in a cup for $6.35 u want decent amount of ice cream... I told the lady at the cash register she said this is it ...the cups are large .... what a waste of money will never step foot in this store again ... notice they didn\\'t even get high ratings in this location... customer service is zero!!!!Alvin, the manager, what a word I can\\'t say. Arrogant, unprofessional, and ignorant. I ordered from grub hub and online they have spicy garlic listed as a dry rub. It came as a sauce. When I asked him the difference between a rub and a sauce he said I\\'m not going to answer any questions. Alvin stated this was grub hubs mistake even though they are a third party delivery service. He also changed the name of the smart mouthed hostess from Sabrina to brandy. I was advised to contact grub hub in regards to the confusion. Alvin was also rude to that employee stating he would not be doing anything to address the misconception. I was not looking for a freebie. I wanted them to correct their misleading menu. Will be going to corporate asap...never going to hooters again.I was shocked that a half of southwest chicken salad was $6.00. I realize at the airport you typically pay more but I found this a big rip off.  Not to mention it was not big at all. It was worth perhaps $4.00 totalThese posers don\\'t allow dogs on their patio. Way to turn away customers! Suck it nerds!!This place is garbage now and it upsets me because it used to be my favorite place in town to get a good pizza. The new owners lowered the quality and taste of the pizza, they even use canned sauce and frozen dough unlike the previous owners who would make their sauce. I never write reviews but this needed to be said. How much do I have to pay to get the old owners and pizza back!Gameplay is fun but horribly disorganized facility.\\n\\nBartenders are slow. We could have had 2 drinks before they even took our order.\\n\\nNo reservations taken unless you pay 50 dollars to skip queue, which we only found out late. \\n\\nHalf the bays were open yet we were made to wait 2 and a half hours, after which we left.\\n\\nDrinks were good, once we got them, food was decent except for the chips, which were disgusting. Like Doritos without flavoring.\\n\\nMusic was awful.\\n\\nTypical Scottsdale douche baggery, except with no sense of business and lame customer service.\\n\\nPrices are also on the high end making the experience even worse.We took our grandmother here for a going away dinner before she moved to a different city, sadly it was not what we came to expect from red lobster. \\nThe air conditioner was cranked to the max and it was a chilly day to begin with , so when our food finally arrived it was cold before we got to taste it. We had ordered endless shrimp and after our first round of shrimp we waited for our waiter to return for over 15 minutes , and after we ordered the second shrimp selection they didn\\'t make it to our table for another 20 minutes and after the rest of us had finished our entire meals . \\nWe then asked for the bill and when we finally got it the waiter didn\\'t return to cash us out. We actually had to walk to the front to pay . \\nWe asked the manager to speak about our service and he told us to wait a moment and he would be right back , but never returned . \\nService at its finest .... lolWe visited last week.  Be Warned! My husband\\'s sister ordered a cheeseburger.  The waiter asked how she wanted it cooked and explained that \"Medium\" would be pink through-out.  She ordered the burger medium.  It took a very long time for our food to arrive and when it did, her burger was cooked very well done.  The waiter offered to have another burger made.  We had waited quite a while, and everyone was nearly done with their meals, all of us sharing with my sister-in-law whom still had no burger.  The waiter came by and my sister-in-law said to just cancel the order because we had already waited too long for it.  He said that he would take care of it.  A few minutes later, someone who appeared to be a manager came to the table delivering the burger we had already asked to be removed from the order.  My sister in law, frustrated at this point stated \"No, I don\\'t want it now\".  The manager walked away.  A few minutes later I noticed the manager with a waiter standing in the middle of the restaurant pointing at our table and mocking my sister-in-law like a school yard bully.  I very discreetly informed our waiter that I thought it was highly inappropriate for his manager to behave in such a way.  Moments later the manager stormed up to our table and began raising his voice at me and scolding me for my \"perception\" about what had taken place.  He then went on to blame the whole incident on the waiter, who had done nothing wrong.  I won\\'t be back.This is the response I get after my review. 1 it\\'s doesn\\'t take 2 hours to get someone suits they have ordered. I clearly stated they came that day cause guys were in from out of town.  Your excuses are bullshit. For the unsatisfactory service. I have no need to call you. I was in there already and expressed my opinion of the company and how horrible service was and all I was told was sorry. My fiance talked to someone there and came in and was told the same thing. You need  a better system of doing things. A 2hour wait for someone to even bring out suits already paid for yo try on is unsatisfactory. My brother in law was there hours prior and waited so long he had to leave also. And you gave him the wrong suits. No other place to rent a suits from needs so many adj. And to actually have to check for stains. What are the people who wash the suits doing. There where stains on everyone\\'s. .. my husband was in a wedding 2 weeks prior with a rental suit ordered on line. Fit perfect. No adj. Needed and your stuff looks so worn over and stitched so many times.. save your breath from any other comments..Was dragged here on a Saturday night after a birthday dinner. I knew things were bad even as we approached the entrance. I could hear the music blaring from down the walkway, and when we walked in I felt like I was going deaf. The DJ they had was cranking his levels to obnoxious extremes, and with the sterile decor the sound was bouncing in all the wrong directions. It didn\\'t help that the DJ was terrible to begin with.\\n\\nThe bartenders ranged from jock-like dudes and cleavage-heavy women. All of them seemed slow at their jobs and were too consumed pouring dozens of shots and making fancy drinks to get any of us a simple beer. We drank pints of Kronenbourg, which tasted really off and quite gross.\\n\\nThe washroom situation was one I wish I could have avoided: a bunch of drunk dudes waiting in line and hitting on any woman who happened to be waiting as well. I let a couple girls go ahead of me in order to avoid the onslaught of lame pick-up lines.\\n\\nThe crowd was a mixed bag. My girlfriend said the only people who go here are people who already live in Liberty Village, which makes sense seeing as I don\\'t see why anyone who lives elsewhere in Toronto would specifically make there way here.\\n\\nWe stayed here for about 30 minutes. Terrible in every category.Britney is one of the few stars that has ever existed that can command an entire arena, that emits spiritual and psychic positive energy through her voice and performance that has the power to change how an audience feels.  I have seen this countless times, at nightclubs: boring after boring song comes on, but when the DJ plays Britney suddenly the room erupts.  Very few performers had the ability to do this, in history.  Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, Judy Garland... the names on this list are surprisingly few.  However, Britney Spears is one of them.  She has the power to illuminate a room, and the World, with her work.  I am not quite sure she realizes this, she is probably far too humble, which is an integral part of  her mysterious Greatness... but I digress.\\n\\nI did not feel the staff at the Axis theater were worthy of her.  They were rude, rushed me into my seat and out of the theater just as soon as they could, and I barely had time to buy a tee- shirt.  I snuck next to the glass display to take a picture next to the \"oops\" outfit, and they practically yelled at me.  More so than anything they actually did, their demeanor was extremely GRUFF.  I can\\'t think of a better way to put it.  Nothing exactly happened... no one slapped me in the face or kicked me in the arse... but their words were short, rude, aggravated, impatient, and unsympathetic to a fan that had traveled 5 hours that very day (from Los Angeles) to see his idol.\\n\\nI am a huge fan of Elvis as well, so we stayed at the previous Hilton where he\\'d performed and had a fine time touring Elvis\\' old dressing room. We went to 1 Oak, had a Crab Buffet, and had a mini shopping spree at the Forum Shops. But of all the fun things we did AFTER, I could not shake in the back of my mind the negative cloud of what I\\'d experienced at the place that drew us to Vegas to begin with.  These people need to realize how much being in that theater means to some people... it is almost a spiritual experience.  When Britney levitated from the tree during Toxic, I almost felt my soul levitate, too! \\n\\nShame on them, for poisoning such a momentous experience.  As usual, ignorant peons in the world will spoil Greatness.  But there is enough negativity in the world, a point I think Spears herself combats with her positive soul and music.  There need not be any negativity in the arena of a performer who does so much to expunge the world\\'s ugliness, and there need not be unhappiness spread in the very Pantheon where Spears herself is employed to make us happy.  She was born to make us happy, that is her soul\\'s purpose... so let her do so without the grumblings of those who can only think of what they are going to have for dinner after their shift is over. \\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nNicholas KafantarisSo I called the company for a price quote to remove a kitchen sink and install a new kitchen sink and to use the existing faucet. The garbage disposal needed to be taken off and then placed back on. There was no major retrofitting of the drain coming out from the wall. A standard kitchen sink installation. My jaw dropped to the floor! $3500. So I wasn\\'t sure I heard him correctly. I thought perhaps he may have misunderstood me or I him . I reviewed what I wanted and he reaffirmed the price. BLA HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! Be very afraid!CHOOSE A DIFFERENT AIRLINE!\\nInitially,  I was a fan of Allegiant.   Early on , my extended family used it to get to Vegas from the Midwest.  But in the past year, Allegiant has failed miserably in delivering on time performance, bags, customer service , and cancellations.  Allegiant is not a large enough airline to be required to provide on time performance data, but on my last two trips to the Vegas airport, the information boards only showed ONE Allegiant flight that was not delayed on departure.   Not weather, not ATC, but all mechanical issues.  \\n\\nIf you are willing to risk delays or cancellation,and view an airline trip as a rapid long distance bus ride on aircraft that are not up today\\'s standards for technology, Allegiant is an option.   If you value on time performance, and expect some measure of good customer service, choose a different airline.Half the tables were empty and they still couldn\\'t be bothered to bring me a menu (I got my own) or even come over to take my order after 15 minutes. Ridiculously bad service.I went to Streetcar Po-Boys fully intent on enjoying an authentic Louisiana po-boy.  The restaurant is in a sketchy area of town, literally right next door a strip club.  They\\'re located in a run down building, which still reeks of the days it spent as a Chinese restaurant.  Everything is in disrepair: there is a large piece of plywood in the middle of the front door, perhaps from a prior break-in?, the carpet is worn down to nothingness, the fluorescent lights are overwhelming, and blinding, which exposes and magnifies every fault of the restaurant.  There is nothing cohesive about the interior of this restaurant, and the senses are left confused and probably offended.\\nThe menu is decent, it is after all a sandwich shop.  The po-boys all sound enticing, with everything from crawfish and oysters, to turkey and gravy, and even a vegetarian option.  The sweet tea is authentic, and the servers are incredibly warm and welcoming, and after ordering, for a brief moment, you\\'re left feeling optimistic.\\nBut here again, the weird, decrepitness of the restaurant messes everything up.  You find yourself sitting in weird booths that seem to have come out of a 1950s diner, being served drinks in Caesar\\'s Palace cups, staring at open shelving that\\'s yellowed over time, and now contains a hodgepodge of low-quality bulk restaurant items.  Heat lamps are hung clumsily from yellow chains, low-quality, inkjet printed signs are posted everywhere, the kitchen doors seem to be bloated from water damage, and there\\'s a pervasive odour of old Chinese food mixed with mould.  It\\'s sad, and I was waiting to see Gordon Ramsey come screaming out of the kitchen, cursing everything.\\nThe food, was mediocre at best.  The fried pickles were super oily, the meat used on the sandwiches was the lowest, lowest, lowest quality.  I ordered the \"Ragin Cajun,\" which was to come with turkey, gravy and fries.  I thought it would come with shaved, fresh turkey slices, smothered in hot gravy, and loaded with fries.  Nope.  Two flimsy turkey slices, made from waaaay over processed \"meat,\" and about 5 french fries literally smashed atop the \"meat.\"  It was served warm-ish, with a stingy amount of fries on the side.  The meat was so gross, I couldn\\'t eat it.\\n\\nOverall, with even the slightest investment, this could be a great Las Vegas eatery, but it\\'s location, the building, and the low-quality ingredients make it so I\\'ll never go back, and I certainly won\\'t recommend it to anyone - and in the restaurant industry, that\\'s the kiss of death.I\\'ve been coming to Armando\\'s since they opened, I\\'ve only drive through and at any drive through you have to expect the person taking the order might have trouble hearing for whatever reason. Tonight I went to the drive through and the menu board light was off. I asked the person to turn on the light so I can see the menu. They didn\\'t understand what I said so I raised my voice so they could hear me he said to come to the window. When I got to the window the I said I asked you to turn on the light so I could see the menu. That somehow insulted the person and I was told to go somewhere else. Ok easy I went to fredricos on happy valley problem solved. It\\'s a shame the Help can\\'t understand plain English. I will never bother them again. Mediocre Mexican food is everywhere and not hard to find. Armondos just lost a customer because the sensitive snowflake can\\'t understand what I was try to say. I recommend filabertos, frericos, or even Taco Bell before Armando\\'s.Slowest service at any chipotle I\\'ve ever been to. The online ordering process is always screwed up - never ready when it\\'s supposed to be, always missing items. Other than that, great...Ordered 2 big dinners here and drove to pick them up. Upon arrival the girl who came out of the restrooms with a broom was pretty rude from the getgo by TELLING me to go to the OTHER register. She brought the BIG shopping bag of food out and I gave her a Bob Evans coupon that was on my phone. She took it upon herself to CAREFULLY read every word and informed me that you could NOT use it to purchase a TURKEY entree ! I could NOT even see all the tiny fine print. So I was counting on the bill being $4 off because I had a valid coupon $4 off $20 . I had another Bob Evans paper coupon with me and asked to use that coupon. She CAREFULLY studied it and said I could use THAT coupon for a turkey entree EXCEPT that is for DINE IN ONLY.  So I let her know that I would have to leave the 2 meals there and I was sorry I could NOT buy them without the $4 coupon being used. She said...O.K. and I will tell you 100% for sure, My family and I always had breakfast here for a LONG time but because of the $4 coupon, I will NEVER,EVER return here due to the TERRIBLE \"CUSTOMER SERVICE\" and COMMON SENSE that is lacking from this girl. Choose to accept a $4 coupon by manually entering $4 with the help of the manager OR refuse a LEGITIMATE $4 coupon because it \"can not be used for a turkey entree\" and piss off a customer that will NEVER come back and they LOOSE a BIG SHOPPING BAG OF FOOD now and throw it in the trash. Great Call cashier girl ! LolI know you work at a car wash, but put a little pride in your work. Car never gets clean here.I wish I could  give them no stars!!!  This is the worse place ever!!!!! 1st- super Dirty 2nd- everything broken including arcade games 3rd employees not professional at all!!!! \\n\\nReally Dirty and Old!!!Ordinarily I wouldn\\'t go here, but since it was walking distance from my hotel and I had no desire to drive on the snowy roads, chain food became acceptable fare.  \\nI want to know why this place has Cajun blackened mahi-mahi on the menu when they don\\'t cook it with an ounce of Cajun seasoning?  I got a plain grilled fish.  The cauliflower and cheese side was nearly indistinguishable from the mashed potatoes.  Only small chunks of cauliflower which probably had all the nutrients cooked out of them signaled which dish I was eating.Done, gone, repossessed!  How you have a semi-crowded to crowded bar yet cannot pay your bills I have to figure out.Waited in line for over an hour. There were eight people working the counter but only three or four of them were actually helping people. No idea why this is so slow. No excuse for making people wait in line over an hour to rent a car. Will never use Budget again.This is probably the worst experience I have ever had with in n\\' out in my entire 29 years on this planet. This chain closes at 1:30 AM on Saturday nights. I specifically pulled up at 1:29 AM when they proceeded to turn the lights off in the drive-through and failed to even acknowledge my presence. They served the car in front of me yet failed to even speak to me. This is not my first rodeo upon closing hour, and the right thing to do would have been to take one last order before that 1:30 mark. We pulled up and they made sure to cut the lights 30 seconds AFTER we pulled up into the drive-through. This is the closest chain to my house but sadly I will not be returning unless somebody makes it right. Sincerely, a very unhappy camper.Ordered delivery for me and the kids. Two hours later, our meal arrived. I called to inquire after about an hour. Was told that the delivery was on the way. Minutes later received a call that it was being fired and would be delivered soon. Do you think it was on the house? Nope. Just got a piece of cheesecake and  20% coupon. Not good enough. \\nNow, let\\'s talk food. The meatball \"panini\" was a piece of French bread with a bland/acidic sauce. The meatballs were overcooked and dry. Not a pleasant experience. The pizza sauce was also watery and bland. You\\'d think that a place called \"Sauce\" would have figured it out by now. Not so.The food is MEDIOCRE. I usually don\\'t do Yelp reviews, but I feel like I was robbed... I had the Pupusa plate - Salvadorian/Mexican plate. First of all, as I smelled the plate I thought this smells like microwave and old...hmm maybe not too many people order this plate. Second, I thought the menu said potatoes and bread- nope didn\\'t happen. Third, overpriced. Fourth, the food 100% didn\\'t taste fresh - smell, taste, texture, you named it it WASN\\'T fresh. Fifth, I ended up in the bathroom. Sadly to say, try another place for exquisite food. I hate to do bad reviews on small businesses....However, something has to change read and pay attention to the YELP reviews. I didn\\'t bother complaining because of the other reviews, sounds like the staff/owner do not take too well on reading/hearing criticism or simply from a PAYING customer. Good luck.Made my online reservation with Hertz as part of my airline discount package in order to rent a car for the weekend of Electric Daisy Carnival 2011. Everything within an hour Vegas was BOOKED solid, and I mean solid. I was able to find one of the lodges 2 hours out of town that had space, so I was set. \\n\\n***Here is the important part of the entire review: I got a discount because it was PREPAID.\\n\\nI got off of work, made it to the airport on time, checked in early, everything a-ok, even had my print out of my reservation and info to pick up my car rental at 10pm on Friday. I go to the ticket counter, and the staff is taking their time. Fine, I can still make it to the lodge on time and check in. This is also important, because the front desk is not open 24 hours. After midnight your screwed. The receptionist was willing to wait up til 1am for me to check in, though. But no later, as this place is so small no one else is at the desk until 5am. With only a few people in line in front of me, I should be ok.\\n\\nNope. Staff is so incompetent and computer system is so archaic that 30 minutes passes before the NEXT person is served. The manager tries to get people to use the Hertz electronic kiosk, as she can tell we are all frustrated with how SLOW the service is. I\\'m a savvy travel and think this should not be a problem and take the kiosk route with a few others. But the couple in front of me have issues with their reservation, and flag down the manager to help them (she is VERY pregnant and can\\'t deal with the stress of 10 minutes of nothing working).\\n\\nMy turn at the kiosk. I try several different methods to get my reservation. Scan my print out. Type in my reservation number. Put in my credit card info again. 15 minutes of attempts, and nothing. By now I would\\'ve been in the front of the line. Finally the kiosk recognizes me, and tells me to SEE AN ATTENDANT about my issue. I get back in line and wait another 10 minutes before anyone can help me (thank God they didn\\'t put me in the BACK of the line again). \\n\\nAt this point I WASTE another 10 minutes as the reservations agent at the terminal can\\'t get my reservation to go through, despite the print out and online info on my phone. THEY ARE SURE WILLING TO TAKE YOUR MONEY, BUT NOT GIVE YOU THE CAR. They cannot take the credit card I provided. YET THEY WERE ABLE TO TAKE THE MONEY. \\nWhen I showed them that I had been charged already (yes, I brought out my bank transactions, this has happened before and this usually works) they STILL WOULD NOT RENT ME THE CAR I HAD ALREADY PAID FOR. \\n\\nNow the manager gets involved, as she can sense my frustration with the staff to a perfectly simple and logical transaction. And what can she do about it? Nothing. Not willing to get on the phone and talk to Hertz, or to over ride. Is this for REAL? A rental service that operates 24 hours a day and you can\\'t get anyone on the phone to fix this issue? And she wasn\\'t going to try? EVEN THOUGH THE RESERVATION FOR THE RENTAL WAS PREPAID AND YOU TOOK MY MONEY?!\\n\\nBy now in my anger I had missed the call that the receptionist at the lodge was checking in with me. Whatever TIME I had buffered to make it to the extended deadline to check in at the lodge was now SLIPPING AWAY. Knowing that my frustration was mounting, I walked away and waited in line at another car rental agency and got a car. \\n\\nThat\\'s right. Walked up, waited in line 5 minutes, talked to an agent from a competitor and got them to MATCH MY CAR TYPE AND DISCOUNT with HERTZ and get the paperwork car within 10 minutes TOTAL. I went back to the HERTZ desk and asked to make sure I was getting a REFUND FOR A CAR RENTAL THAT WAS PREPAID THAT I WAS  *NOT* GETTING. \\n\\nGuess what the manager said?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nAt this point I cussed out the agent that initially helped me and the manager because they know NOTHING about customer service. You can\\'t release the cat to the same credit card you were MORE THAN WILLING TO TAKE PREPAID MONEY FROM, and WON\\'T REFUND THE MONEY when you can\\'t give me the car. No print out that says I was NOT given my car when I call Hertz billing come Monday. \\n\\nBy now it\\'s 11:30pm Friday night when I drive off in a non-HERTZ car, and I have to fly like a bat out of hell to make the deadline at the lodge. I would have to deal with Hertz later, as I had wasted enough time with them.\\n\\nI\\'ve rambled enough, but in short guess who SLEPT IN THE CAR in the parking lot of the lodge? Surely it wasn\\'t a HERTZ car that I slept in, no sir-ree -bob! \\n\\nIn summary, even with all the paperwork, print outs, online info and correct identification info on my person, HERTZ would not rent me my prepaid car, nor would they refund it. Due to the length of incompetent  time and poor service I received at Hertz, I did not make my reservation on time at my lodging. \\n\\nAVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.\\n\\np.s. Guess who is on hold with Hertz billing as I write this?In the daytime the owners work so don\\'t go there because they\\'re mean with the portions it totally sucks ... if I go in there and see the wife or the husband I\\'ll be turning around... fuck that bitchFast service on the night I went, part of 4. horrible food - deep fried calamari was so dipped in so much batter it was rock hard; tom yum soup was way too sweet instead of sour and spice; stir-fry was oily. Save you $ and time, go elsewhere.Not impressed.  The place had a stale odor when we walked in.  We thought we would still give it a chance.  I wanted a Moscow mule.  No such luck.  We left after the first drink.I would never use this company.\\n\\nWe called for a Taxi on new years at around 9 o\\'clock, they said many were in the area and we should expect one soon. We then called back at 10.30 after no cab had arrived, and they said they would let the driver\\'s know we\\'d been waiting an hour and a half and that there were taxis in the area. Finally we called back at 11:00 having already missed our show, and we were told that there was no way we could get a cab that night. Why didn\\'t you just tell us from the start we were never going to get a cab? \\n\\nAbsolute worst service, from the grumpiest people I\\'ve ever experienced. I sincerely hope you go out of business.I stopped by this morning to pick up a latte and a muffin on my way to work - it was around 10am, so long after the morning rush (if there is such a thing in Harrisburg). I waited and waited and waited for about 5 minutes for the barista to stop flirting with a customer who was in front of me - they were basically just chatting - then I threw up my arms and left. I want to support local business as much as the next guy, but at least I know if I walk into a Starbucks, I can get in and out in 5 minutes.\\n\\nSkip this place, if you have anywhere to be. Got time to waste? This is just the place.I do not like writing a terrible review due to terrible customer service at the front desk. \\nHowever, the front desk took the position of me being rude when they cancelled my Open Table reservation stating they did not accept online reservations. Interesting how they were able to cancel the online reservation. They also made false statements about my language when they were being rude to everyone looking for a table. \\nBeen there in the past and enjoyed dinner. Too bad a nasty attitude loses you business and negative reviews.It\\'s full of old ladies (tías calientes)... Drinks are over priced, and well drinks are no longer 5 dollars. False advertisement...  Pre-game before or go somewhere else.The woman who books the cleaning appointments was incredibly rude with me. Given that she is in the service industry, she should re-think that way that she treats customers. In addition, I rarely had the same person clean my home, and the quality of cleaning was extremely variable. I would not recomment this service.I\\'m sure this was exciting for many people. I, however, could not wait for the torture to end. Too loud, uncomfortable chairs and sucky if you\\'re not a Beatles fan. Maybe the \"regular\" cirque show would have been a more worthwhile experience.\\n\\nHad to exit to ask an attendant for ear plugs so that I could rejoin my party and not appear rude.Worst MAC location ever!!! After repeated attempts and fails I am no longer returning to this MAC even though it is the closest to my house... I am even considering switching my holy grail eyeliner to another brand entirely as the people who work MAC counters generally look like street walkers (and not in a good way- if there is a good way!)- not edgy, like I think they are going for! They are lazy and you have to go over to them and get in their face to get them to help you and basically hand them the product. And then they don\\'t even say \\'hi\\' or ask \\'how are you?\\'- you know, the bare minimum that is to be expected in ANY human intereaction- let alone a customer service interaction at a retailer where they want my money!  I used to spend tons at MAC and now I have moved on to more luxurious things and better service at the Chanel counter... though definitely not at this Dillards- the customer service is atrocious all over at this mall! I really don\\'t know how some of these people have jobs.  Sorry if some of my reviews seem harsh lately, but I am no longer standing for this kind of crap service.I had my screen fixed here and the next day it cracked. They would not honor the 30 day guarantee. I would NEVER recommend this place. Poor customer service. Do not waste your money.I went here for lunch today, craving a green chile burrito. No cars in front of me or behind me in drive-thru, but I had a semi-long wait. I was ok with that since most restaurants of the like make it fresh and it\\'s worth it. Burrito was a great size for the price, the green chile sauce was okay. But the meat was dry and stringy and not saturated/infused with green chile as if it had been marinating all day, like it should. Maybe this is just not their winner and I\\'ll try something different another time probably, especially since it\\'s so close to my work.Holy crap I am never doing this airline again! I know with budget airlines, you get what you pay for but this airline is beyond terrible and needs a lot of improvement. There are fees tacked on for everything and you have to be careful with what you are doing. This is my first time taking Allegiant and usually we take United Airlines. My mother and I took Allegiant to Las Vegas from Colorado Springs and we weren\\'t expecting much after reading all of the other reviews. My disabled mother was not able to get her carry on into the overhead bins and asked a flight attendant for help. The flight attendant\\'s response was to \"do it yourself\". Flight attendants are supposed to help those in need! Our flight was late leaving the gate, seats would not recline on the MD-80, they did an inflight beverage service but charged for every damn thing you would normally get for free such as orange juice and water. There wasn\\'t any snacks, speakers were way too loud and we had an even crappier experience at the Las Vegas airport. We bought the shuttle thing to take us to and from the airport for about $30. People around us said they got it for $12. Our paper said nothing about the shuttle, where we were supposed to go, what shuttle looks like, etc. We waited a very long time for the shuttle! We were told by one of the employees that we were going to the Hilton Elara and to get into line 2, he later told us the bus was approaching and to go to line 1. The driver looked at our papers and told us we were in the wrong line and line 2 is the one we want. Very aggravating that so much went wrong with everything that had to do with Allegiant. I might do a budget airline again but never Allegiant, they are so disorganized and rude. They don\\'t know what good customer service is, and I am warning everyone I know about them!Very disappointing. Walked in when the patio was empty. Asked for a table for 2. Advised of a 20 minute wait based on reservations. 45 minutes later we still had no table and the patio was empty.Beds don\\'t fit Canadian mattresses. We have been completely misled and have been trying to return a bed back to the store for a week and Muji has been asking us to pay for returning the bed! Calls are not answered, messages are not returned and staff don\\'t seem to know what mujis operating procedures are\\n\\nUpdate - 9 months later Muji refuses to refund me the pick up money owed. Additionally Muji claimed that dimensions in store, catalog and online are for \"guidance\" only when there was no commentary like that anywhereHorrible! Had to leave as soon as we saw the room. Dead roaches on the bench/couch by window. Made a face when we told them we didn\\'t wanna stay and wanted our money back. They were rude. Unorganized. And filthy rooms. I strongly suggest to not even think about staying there. Deserves no stars because it\\'s really a crappy place.I came here for oil change. Service is really terrible. I am seating and waiting right now, very uncomfortable. The way they talk to me, so rude. What is going on here? I think all workers here hate their jobs.And management allowed a worker to place her stuff all over a counter and fight with me because I took a picture of the garage sale going on in this restaraunt. This girl had serious issues and if this is the management style then new management is needed to be replaced also. I paid for my shake, never drank it and went on my way. Not sure if the owners read this but they need a serious talk with the staff of this place. Feel free to contact me if you want all the issues.This experienced my family and I had today was outrageous the food was cold undercooked and when you send it back the waitress got annoyed The Bloomin Onion well what can I say I don\\'t know what they\\'ve done with it but it\\'s not anything what it was before it\\'ll be a long time before we step foot in this place again if ever the biggest part of this is they don\\'t care.Service is terrible. \\n\\nThere were 2 of us, the hostess sat us with only one menu. After we had to take turns to share the menu, we finally decided on our entrees. 30 minutes passed, no one ever approached the table so we decided to leave. On our way out I wanted to let the hostess know that we were never greeted, after which she asked \"what table number were you at?\" How am I supposed to know? Is it a requirement to know your table number in order to get waited on?I was quite disappointed with it. Water all mucky, not much greenery or botany. Even if you do want to go for a stroll, it\\'s very small. \\n\\nI don\\'t know, maybe I came at the wrong time? Wasn\\'t worth the drive and looking for parking..Honest review: Made an appointment at 12:30 was waiting for an hour and nothing, 2 people came in after me and was seen, bot to mention after every haircut they each took a 10 min smoke break, as i was walking out (without a haircut) they yelled, next time make an appointment bro..... \\n\\nDont go here unless you\\'re a regular customerIf I could give this place a zero, I would. We had top shelf margaritas. Basically good tequila with very bad store mix and a little guest fruit fly. Atmosphere and service was about the same.Aggressive driving and going thru red lights on Forbes Ave May not be ideal for a towing company - ambulance perhaps but not towing. Please drive better.This was the worst pizza I have ever had. The cheese and sauce had both a sour taste and smell. The crust was bland and hard. The price was right at $3.99 so I gave it a try instead of going to a pizza franchise...but it was too horrible to eat.Came here with a group of friends last time. It is usually good so I\\'m not sure what happened. We came on a weekend during yum cha hours where they push carts and should have everything ready. Their siu mai is pork and shrimp and it was raw. We sent it back and they gave us another one... which was also raw. We went it back AGAIN, and it came back AGAIN RAW. You can\\'t serve raw pork to ur customers. Luckily my friend checked it because I\\'m sure most people don\\'t and just eat it and get food poisoning later. The jelly fish we ordered , they Gave us the end of jelly fish which was hard and not edible. We complained and asked them for a new dish but they refused to give us a new jelly fish order. I would give it 2 stars because all my other experiences were great except this one but honestly, giving it one star only because the siu mai came back raw 3 times and that\\'s just unacceptable.More coupon issues, this time with target coupons out of their little 4th of july promo book. The computer won\\'t over read their own coupons and the cashier was rude and incompetent I left with out the item and went down the street and bought it elsewhere.  I don\\'t know why I bother to continue to try this store, and other target is better then this and they just don\\'t seem to care. Go to North Olmsted or W117th instead.Whatever you do, stay away from any free deal these people offer for you to sit through their timeshare presentation!!! On the paperwork it says the presentation lasts for 2-2 and a half hrs. Well when we showed up, our salesman told us we would be with him for the next 3 hrs. He was so nice at first, got along with my friend and I, laughed a lot and then when we asked how much the timeshare was, he wouldn\\'t answer and kept changing the subject. He took us outside to show us the \"beautiful view\" which was dead desert. Not too beautiful to me. He walked us to the common room where people hangout and watch tv, everyone had to be 75 yrs and older, I am 30. It seemed more like a retirement home than a timeshare. I noticed it had been over two hrs and thanked him for his time but we weren\\'t interested. He said we were not allowed to leave until the 3 hrs was up. I told him I signed a paper which said I only had to stay for two to two and a half hrs. He said if we left we would not receive the free things we were promised. So at this point we have literally been blackmailed and kidnapped since what I signed said I could leave after two hrs.  I figured we could tough it out since it would only be another 45 minutes. That 45 minutes felt longer than the first 2 hrs. These guys don\\'t know the word no, they do not listen to you and they turn into assholes after they know you won\\'t buy from them. I said no about 30 times and the manager walks up, tells us a guy is selling his timeshare and I can get it for the price of $12,000. Half price of what the timeshare was (which was a complete lie) I said no. He then lowered it to $4,000. Again, I said no. He then offered me the timeshare for free and all I had to do was pay the $1,000 taxes each year and put down $1400 today and my week stays would be the $209 a week. I swear if I had to hear them say \" and for ONLY $209 a week you can stay ANYWHERE in the world\" one more time, I was going to scream. They made my friend cry out of frustration of not allowing us to leave  at the 3 hr mark and they kept pressuring us and wouldn\\'t sign the paper saying we finished the presentation. It was like they wanted to make us so mad I would just sign up so they would shut up. When you don\\'t listen to a girl when she says no, hold her against her will and make her cry and say sexual remarks about her body the entire time it\\'s a close feeling to being sexually abused.....not okay.....At 3 hrs and 20 minutes we were finally told we could leave.....finally free. We were sent to another room to tell a man how our presentation went. As my friend was still crying we told him how awful it was. He had to fill out a questionnaire on our answers and the question on the page said \"how was the presentation\" after we told him how awful they were to us I saw him write \"good\" on the answer line.....he straight up lied on their questionnaire! I then was sent to another man to get my 4 free nights at the Luxor and my $200 deposit back. He said it would take two days to be put back into my account. It took over a week. When we got on the bus, everyone had similar stories. I was the only one who was dumb enough to put a $200 deposit down. So if you do want to visit Hell on earth for free stuff, you do NOT have to put the deposit down! Don\\'t do it. We all agreed it was not worth the free stuff they promise.My nephews and niece wanted Mexican for dinner and they mentioned this place.  I was not impressed.  1st the ordering system is really out of the ordinary and complicated when trying to order for 6 people.  They have 3 different lines for specific types of tacos so if you are wanting to try different types you will have to stand in all three lines.  The thing that really upset me was the terrible service.  I mentioned to the lady who was walking around that it was my first time visiting and she shrugged her shoulders and didn\\'t offer me any direction on how to order.  I finally figured it out after watching other people order so I got in line.  2nd the guy making the tacos was super rude and almost annoyed at the fact that I was ordering different types of tacos.  3rd when I finally made it to the register to pay I had to wait until the girl at the register was done talking to another employee about how she couldn\\'t wait to get out of work.  I\\'m standing there holding a tray with 25 tacos and she doesn\\'t even bother to say one moment please they just ignore me as if I\\'m not even there.  4th the food was cold because the meats are sitting in a bin and all they do is chop it up when you order it, they don\\'t even reheat it. I\\'m assuming the holding bin is suppose to keep the meats hot but it wasn\\'t.  Qualify of meat gets a C.  Flavor gets a D.  Service gets an F.  I will not be back.Most unprofessional business I\\'ve ever dealt with. We had them scheduled to move us out of our apartment for over a week, and they called less than 24 hours before the move to cancel on us. They claimed their truck was in the shop, but I have a very hard time believing that they only have one truck available to move customers. It really put us in a bind and we are now trying to find movers at the last minute, which is extremely difficult.What a horrible experience! I came here with friends on a Saturday afternoon shortly after landing in Las Vegas. I came specifically because my co workers told me how great the Patron Milkshakes are and that the food was tasty! \\n\\nWell first blow to my experience was that they were out of Patron milkshakes! Can someone explain to me how a restaurant that is located on the strip of Las Vegas on a Saturday afternoon is out of anything?!! I was livid. They told me that they were out of the milkshake mix but not the Patron. Sounds like bad managing of inventory if you ask me. \\n\\nSecondly the customer service was horrible. They did not offer a replacement drink for my troubles and our waitress was switched out without warning and the first waitress gave us the wrong information. She allowed my friends to order $19 bottomless mimosas and then after serving the mimosas told them that the deal would end in about 10 minutes!! Wth!! Basically meaning that in 10 minutes they had to drink as many as they could. That\\'s horrible. \\n\\nThe waitress ended up taking it off of the bill but here is where it gets worse. \\n\\nThe mimosas were watered down like they had been pre-made and were sitting in a pitcher of ice all day. They must do better than that. The food was disgusting. The English muffin on my eggs Benedict was stale and hard. The hollandaise sauce lacked flavor and my food was cold. I\\'m just so fed up with place. Do yourself a favor and don\\'t waste your time. Maybe try Shake Shack next door. Come to think of it. I should\\'ve just gone next door ordered a shake from shake shack and told them to put Patron in it. But I was so pissed off and in complete disbelief at the service and experience I couldn\\'t think logically. This place has got to get it together.I work near here so I always go there to get something, and no matter what drink I get, there is ALWAYS  a mistake. Either they didn\\'t make the drink correctly, or add-ons were never added... I try to give them chances and still, there is always something.We had be wanting to try city BBQ and we finally did. If they want to survive in the future they have work to do. The person who takes your order was not very friendly nor did he give the proper attention to the customer. While taking our order he was having a side conversation with someone else. The restaurant was dirty, they have bottles of sauce on every table in squeeze bottles that are transparent however they clearly do not clean the bottles, there was dried old sauce on the tops and in the tip were the sauce comes out. They have a fixing bar also with sauce and it is not very clean either burnt sauce caked in the open containers. See my pictures..... the food was not hot at all. You would expect being a new restaurant that it would be very clean but that\\'s not the case at all. Very disappointing!!!This location really forces you to go through the drive through because parking is not great.  The line seemed to move quickly, but I would make sure to double check your order before you drive away.  Not only did I get the wrong burger, the fries were soggy and I only got one ketchup when I asked for a few.  \\n\\nFeel bad about leaving a bad review but I had no choice in this caseThis company has the WORST customer service EVER!  - they put you on LONG hold times (up to 18 minutes), they take a LONG time to refund your money (40 days), you have no way to reach the Corporate Office.  I finally had to go through the BBB to get results.  \\nThe Whole Chain just isn\\'t worth your time and money.The service is terrible. \\n\\nWe had a huge group going, but it is summer time on campus, and few people\\nwere there. We did our orders in shifts, and I was among the first few. We had\\na few people arriving late, and their orders were taken maybe 10-20 minutes\\nafter mine. After the whole party--except me--got their dishes AND finished them,\\nmine came, with a simple cold indifferent apology. I did go to the waiter to check\\non my dish, and she just said the dish was in line. \\n\\nBe prepared for a long wait with indifferent apology.Ordered delivery and my ordered showed up later than it was supposed to and looked like the following picture. Won\\'t be ordering from here again. Not worth the money and they obviously don\\'t care.Where do I begin? I was admitted in their inpatient program for 7 days for Suicidal thoughts and PTSD. Within those 7 days my wife brought me over 100 dollars in magazines and books to read which the staff lost and wouldn\\'t return her calls to get the refund. Now it\\'s been over a month and not one of the 16 phone calls and 8 emails were returned. Then I started the outpatient program that I wasted 30 days of my life at for Clai the therapist to say She can\\'t treat PTSD and that I just need to get my shit together. Oh and FYI this was after she told me she has a good bullshit meter and that they knew of the suicidal thoughts I had the night before. How she has a job I will never know!! Hope if you are having issues like I have then you will not go there. You may if your lucky get 25mins with a doctor a week. Clai was completely unprofessional and no way should be employed as a therapist. I am active duty military and there are a few others in that program if you can\\'t help ptsd, depression, or suicidal thoughts then you need to resign before you make someone kill themselves. She is going to get someone hurt or worse. If this is how they treat military than by all means brothers and sisters stay away!!!!! Luckily I have a wonderful wife to help who is helping me find the help I need.           \\nUPDATE**** I will never contact this dick face that commented. You guys could give two shits about military and Clai is going to get someone killed.After we were seated by the hostess, we spent 10 minutes waiting for someone to even address us with about 7 waiters and waitresses passing us by. Finally, my friend went to the bar to go get us some waters. I then got up and approached one of the waitresses and asked her if she could help us locate our waiter. Her response was \"go talk to the hostess\". Annoyed, I then asked her if she could send a manager over. She turned around and continued serving her tables. Finally the hostess came over and I asked again to speak to the manager. The manager finally came over to our table and asked \"can I help you?\". I started explaining the situation and he cut me off before I could get one sentence out and asked what we were ordering. He was uninterested in our concern, did not apologize, and made some lame excuse like the hostess shouldn\\'t have brought us there. Our food came out quickly, but they forgot a side salad that we ordered and the food was questionably not warm. The manager never followed up at the end and clearly did not care about our concerns in the slightest. The horrible service and mediocre food is not worth stepping foot in this place.This is the worst property management company I\\'ve experienced in nearly 20 years and 4 homes in the east valley.  I can only hope the board in my neighborhood fires Spectrum. A class of kindergarten students could manage the HOA better than Spectrum.As I waited curbside for the airport shuttle, little did I know what I was about to walk into.  As I piled into the back of the shuttle, and watched it fill up, I thought to myself, \"This must be a popular place.\" Boy was I wrong. As we all lined up for check in (half of us out the door), the front desk announced that they only had one computer working and it would take some time. I was number 7 in line. As I made it up to the marble counter and said hello to the person checking me in and the 4 others who were behind the desk, I noticed that \"old\" smell..... You know that smell that makes you think mildew? Mold? Nope, it was the natural perfume of the entire building (at least the parts that I was in). I was given my room, and I walked in and noticed a GIANT stain on my recently redone carpet, the light fixture was leaning to one side and falling off the wall, and my AWESOME view was a giant satellite dish and what looked like some rusted out shacks in the parking lot.\\nSo I grabbed the remote and was greeted by a bunch of back buttons (the numbers had been worn off). The only one I could read was MENU and it did not work. After figuring out which buttons did what (Thank God I did not end up accidentally buying hotel porn!) I started trying to change the channel. I could change by using the button to look at the next channel up or down the list, but if I hit a number, it would simply sit on the screen. If I wanted channel 24, it would first show channel 2, and after hitting 4 like 5 times, the 2 would be replaced with a 4 and it would sit there until I turned the TV off and turned it back on.\\nThis hotel was a lot like the Monday Night Pre-Season Game I was watching... Not inspiring confidence. After calling down to the front desk and asking for a 7:30 shuttle and a 7 am wake up call, I eat my delivered dinner (I dare not try the hotel\\'s food) and set the Hilton Clock in my room for a 6:45 alarm.\\n\\nThe next morning I woke up on my own at about 6:50 to my alarm clock blinking because the alarm was going off, but the alarm itself was broken. As I walked towards the bathroom, I noticed 2 pieces of paper under my door. It was my bill, but you would not know it. Usually Hilton family hotels print everything (including your bill) on company letter head so you know where it came from. These bills were simply printed on white copy paper. If this was not a metaphor for my whole experience, I do not know what would be. This place does not live up to the Double Tree standard. Not Going Back.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Stay at the Wynn. \\n\\nThis was a terrible stay. I was expecting so much more. \\n\\nChecking in: Rude front desk lady. Even though I had confirmed the type of room (I had purchased a Bella from Vegas.com) the front desk gave me a single bed room. I had to argue with her to get what I paid for. So the start of my trip was poor. \\n\\nStay: Three major issues.\\n\\n1. Internet wifi did not work (the IT guy couldnt figure it out and gave me a freaking hard wire. Who uses a blue wire on the laptop and constrains themselves to the desk!!!). \\n2. The room was dirty (the closet had previous guest\\'s hangers and plastic all around). Had to call housekeeping as soon as we arrived. terrible. \\n3. The lamp in the lounge are of the room did not work. Had to call engineer to fix it. \\n\\n\\nThis was not what I hoped for.One star is generous. I love paying for a large fry and getting a medium disguised as a large. Forget getting the ketchup or napkins. They can\\'t seem to remember that for literally 10 seconds. First stop there in over a year...was desperate and in a rush. And forget calling them...the busy signal is the only customer service you will get.hi,  place posts own fake good reviews, this is a REAL review from a REAL person\\n:\\nthis  is the worst restaurant i have been to in las vegas, first: their baked goods are old and hard ! they buy their bagels frozen and defrost them ( i saw the bag).\\nthe food is awful, . we ordered brisket sandwich, potato salad, chicken soup, salmon platter, pastrami sandwich, hamburger with cole slaw (the hamburger was immediately sent back it was hard and flat as a hockey puck :  (    cole slaw was gross and slimy, ... the sandwiches were tasteless\\nthe pastrami : not edible, the soup was cold and from a can, the potato salad came from a plastic tub. they are making nothing homemade as they \"claim\", the salmon was a salmon substitute ( very gummy after one bite, i was afraid to eat anymore in a chance i would become ill).. all of their food is frozen and microwaved.go buy a frozen sandwich, microwave it thats what our disgusting sandwiches tasted like for quadruple the price!!.. the waitress told me and rolled her eyes, she also told us she found a new waitress job because they have to tell customers food is homemade when nothing is made there and she did not want to lie to customers. i repeat DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HEREI have never written a review on a restaurant before. Based on the reviews, we decided to go to Line Thai tonight. We walked in and were seated. We were given a death trap high chair for our 6 month old and my 5 year old was given nothing. I asked if they had a kids menu and he said no but our only option would be to order a full adult dinner plate for our son. We sat there for at least 10 minutes and nobody had come to the table. The place was NOT busy. It was then that we decided to leave. I have never in my entire life walked out of a restaurant. If I walk in, I order. If I don\\'t like it, I just don\\'t come back. I couldn\\'t even do that here! We were getting up to leave and a waitress finally came to our table. We told her why we were leaving and instead of offering something to get us to stay, she just said \"okay!\" Glad I didn\\'t spend my money here! NOT kid friendly!We asked them for an oil change. Told us in the morning we can do it in the afternoon.\\nAfternoon they told us - we can\\'t do oil change - no time for this. Maybe in 36 hours we will be able to do it.\\nReally ? I asked his first and last name ( over the phone ) and he refused to give it to me.\\nI would\\'ve give them 0 stars if I could !!!!!!!!!!!!!\\nThis is my 2nd experience with them - same thing , NO CHANGES !!!!!!\\nBypass them !!!!!\\nEveryone is rude and unprofessional !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Horrible car wash:((( I left the car wash and after two hours I opened up my passenger side, and nothing was vacuumed or cleaned. I had to drive back and asked for a manager, who came and vacuumed by herself my car. She was nice, but the other employees are not nice at all. I do not recommend at all, will not be going back!!The retail part of the store is fine. There is a large selection of food and accessories. I like that they carry grain-free dog and cat food. However, their current groomer gave my daughter\\'s dog the worst cut!  The poor thing looks ridiculous! The groomer gave her a poodle cut instead of a shitzu cut. When we picked her up, we heard the groomer yelling at a dog she was grooming!  To top it off, the groomer said she had never heard of a \"puppy cut\" or a \"box dryer.\"   I think At Your Service got this women off the street!  The sad part was the staff didn\\'t apologize and actually defended this groomer\\'s horrible work. We are now looking for another place to shop.Beware the breakfast scam. We\\'re told the night before that \"breakfast was 7-10 am.\" Upon showing up we discover however it\\'s actually $12 a person. That part they left out, hmm. Nothing complimentary. I\\'m a light breakfast eater. Had I known, I simply would have been prepared and went to the store the night before. I brought this to the attention of the desk clerk Ryan, whose literal response was that \"there\\'s nothing I can do.\" So if you want a muffin for breakfast you can pay $12 for it here or you can go stay at Motel 6.  There\\'s no free breakfast of any kind at this hotel.Ugh! From hostess, to 15 minutes for a waiter, to mediocre at best food (flautas were blandly acceptable).  Don\\'t waste your time or money.Somebody tried breaking into our room while i was in the tub and Hubby was in the shower, THANK GOD i had the latch locked. They had a key and couldn\\'t open the door because of the latch..\\nScared the S*** out of me. He was banging and kicking the door.  This might have happened at another hotel, but how the F*** did somebody get our room key????!!!!!!!?????!!!!!Dumpy. For the same price you can stay at a much nicer hotel on the strip. Holes and scuff marks on the walls and ceiling (somehow). Had to force open and shut the balcony door since it was stuck. Stains on the sheets. Wi-Fi very slow and constantly cut out. Funniest part of the stay: Called downstairs to ask for a room service menu since there wasn\\'t any in the room and they asked if I could go to the front desk to pick one up...uhhhh no the whole point of room service is being able to order food without having to leave the room. If I\\'m going to go downstairs I might as well go to a nicer restaurant than to eat this hotels overpriced mediocre food...Just yuck..  my 1st choice of fast food failed because it closed early.. so my husband said panda..   wow years since ive been here and what a sad mess.. everyone in front of me wanted stuff they were out of ..  place was busy but out of food.. lots of walk outs and people waiting 6-10 mins for orders.. i dont eat fast food but wanted  egg roll but they were so burnt cooked by untrained or lazy people.  Soooo yucky..I\\'m keeping this short, it was bad enough we wasted an hour in some in there. The place was nice and all, but there wasn\\'t a lot to choose from. A lot was cold already.. Towards the end after we ate most of our meal, we went to go get desert and thats when my husband noticed gnats and mosquitoes. We were instantly turned off and left. Later that night my husband ended up barfing up his whole dinner. Needless to say, we will never come back. And advise strongly against anyone else coming.Customer service is crap. No personality .1 and done for me. So many other Italian eateries in the area..Truly horrible service to both the dog and the human. My dog loves to play around and is energetic (I wouldn\\'t say any more than normal). The first couple of days were good but it went down hill once I bought the package. That\\'s when I saw that they wouldn\\'t pay attention to him and would put him on \"time out\" just when they didn\\'t want to deal with him, this seems to be a common practice for them. They don\\'t care about the dog, they forget to take them out, and forget to give then medicine when they need it. Take your dog literally anywhere else. You are paying to have your dog crated all day.I would rather eat spam than ever walk back into this establishment. To emphasize how bad the experience was I am a vegetarian and I\\'d rather eat spam. I stood there waiting to get sat for over 15 mins, once seated I was greeted by my waitress whom was rude & barely knew English. I proceeded to the buffet the food LOOK amazing but looks fooled me. Once I sat down I realized that the food was cold & hard. I sat in my seat picking at my food around my plate. The assistant manager must\\'ve noticed and walked over asking me what was wrong I didn\\'t want to make a big deal about it because I didn\\'t want to draw any attention but he walked away and minutes came back with a lady whom I will assume was the manager. She walked over with an attitude and accused me of not wanting to pay as though I didn\\'t have $ or something. I felt so degraded I didn\\'t want to argue so I paid even after I paid she had an attitude and told me that she\\'d take $1.00 off of food that I didn\\'t even intake as though she was doing me a favor. While taking my payment her and the assistant manager spoke in their native language arguing back and forth. I believe the assistant manager was arguing on my behalf. Nevertheless I would never ever go back to that establishment ever again even if someone tried to drag me in there!!!This place has not changed at all, I gave it a second chance and it kept disappointing as bad service and food again, spending my money in some place else and real Mexican food thankfully, and the Gabriel guy send me a message trying to make me look as a mean customer, that\\'s not how you treat your customers!!! Thankfully  I won\\'t make business here ever again! Please Find a good place for your money and time, there\\'s plenty of good Mexican places around Arizona. Thx.With so many wonderful restaurants there is no reason to come here.\\nI will never come back.\\nService was bad, food was bad (except the soup), atmosphere was nice although it opens into the slot machines at Luxor.\\n\\nIf you sit at the bar, there is a huge pillar with a flat screen, which is great for watching sports, but hides you away from the bartender if you sit to the righthand side.  \\nI had to get up and get his attention because he couldn\\'t see me.\\nThe girl that sat down next to me actually moved to one of the tables in the lounge because the service was so bad (she did get great service from the cocktail waitress though).\\n\\nThe Wild Mushroom soup was amazing, that is why the restaurant gets a star.  Have the soup, then go somewhere else for the main course.\\n\\nThe steak I ordered was tasteless, I had to order a side of bearnaise sauce to get it down and I love steak; I would eat steak everyday if I could, but not from here even if it was free (which it definately wasn\\'t).  And the bearnaise was tasteless as well.  If I hadn\\'t enjoyed the soup so much I would have thought something was wrong with my sense of taste.\\n\\nThe wine also tasted like it had been opened the day before or maybe even the day before that.  I\\'m not a wine snob, but it was like vinegar.  The bartender didn\\'t even bother pouring a little for himself to see if it had gone bad.\\nThis was the first time in my life I had to refuse a glass of wine.Booked an appointment online and received a confirmation email right away which was great but when I called to courteously let them know I was running late I was told my appointment was not with the person I booked, they left early so I was moved to someone else who also moved up my appointment to start 15min earlier. Seems there was a note to call me. Did they? Nope. Most awesome customer service ever. Will never use or recommend. Be careful ladies.Went there for Cinco DeMayo and was charged 20$ for crappy margaritas. The special started 10 minutes after we ordered. We were never informed that we were getting charged the regular price. Our waitress \"forgot\" about us (her words not mine). The food was not good either.Beef brisket only available once a week. I tried the sub and I\\'d rather go to Subway for a similar sandwich.Favorite chilis love natalie but most horrible service last week with manager that didn\\'t do a great job either. Should have walked out when I found out natalie or jen was not there but decided to stay steak was dry (cooked medium) server never came back to check on us just because we are regulars doesn\\'t mean we do not deserve the same service as any other customer.  We flagged manager down to let him know about steak and all he had to say was did you order dessert. .no!!! Would you like dessert uh no would have liked my steak redone but never offered I ended up just leaving. But to make things worse I asked for their District managers number and they didn\\'t want to give it to me. I had it at home I called him and I\\'ve yet to get a response back on the issue, I wrote an email to the email that they gave me still nothing back from anyone I also went o  website to submit a comment for someone to contact me and a week later nothing. Everyone just be ware of service and management at this location if you so go in ask for natalie she will make sure your shit is right. So funny I am an assistant manager of a restaurant and it\\'s crazy on how they run their business.Awful!  Went to AT and T bc my pictures are fuzzy and was told phone was defective- the lens.  Went to this store and although they had people swarm me anytime I looked at any product - NOBODY could see me about my phone.  Service after the sale of my six plus= zero.  This is exactly why American companies are folding.  Worship the dollar- big bucks.  The customer is last!  The atmosphere in this store is equivalent to a used car lot meets a strip bar.  Never again!  Sorry Apple- for being such a \"liberal\" company you love the dollar- but care little for the people unless one waves $$$$$$$$$ in the air.  Your store is a big silver pile of dung -Now that we have bought out the lease less than 6 months after dealing with Right Toyota, we can not get a refund for our gap insurance that we bought through them. \\n\\nWe are being told from Right that we have to go through the bank, and the bank is telling us we have to go through Right Toyota. \\n\\nThis is a big mess. Dont buy from them.2nd visit. first visit, I said never again. second visit worthy of a Yelp review.\\n\\nordered a 12.99 roast beef with swiss.\\n\\nthe ordering menu says slow roasted homemade roast beef, pulled.\\nit was boiled, and boiled to death! it was so dry I added mustard otherwise I would have choked it was stringy, dry, and tasteless.\\nas for the swiss cheese, sliced so thin I couldnt even hardly find it.\\n\\n2 visits, NEVER AGAIN.1 star bc I couldn\\'t give none. Whatever my waitress\\' is, she was rude. Took 15 mins for me to get a menu and 30 mins for my friend to get a refill. Her service was horrible. We\\'d have to stop her in passing. When I placed my order, she sighed as if I was bothering her. Loaded fries are good but Definitely not coming back!Considering I work in the airport, I know lines are long and most of the employees hate their jobs. I get it. But when you ask for no mayonnaise because your ALLERGIC, you\\'d think to include that part on the note so it can be conveyed to the sandwich maker. Nope. Never happens, the managers are sweethearts, but the employees they need to check into. 4 out of 5 times I get mayonnaise & a dirty look . And sometimes if your extra lucky they will even leave the plastic on the cheese slices for you when you bite into your sandwich.\\n\\nHonestly the one star is for the managers. If I could give the restaurant less stars I would.It was 108 degrees outside and the AC wasn\\'t working. When we asked the owner if he had any extra fans he was EXTREMELY rude in the way he spoke. Soon after, when we got water, there was a bug in the water cup. It was disgusting. Even the food wasn\\'t great. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!The service is horrible, atmosphere is horrible, coffee is horrible, and everything is overpriced.   I won\\'t be going back.last time I trust John Cattucci! you don\\'t gotta eat here! overpriced  quiche, with baby greens ala cosco, 15$ burger w day or two old bun and eggs Benedict you don\\'t gotta go here for,  walk a few blocks north and go to la cubana.Poor service, had to sit there and ask my wife continuesly about why we have been waiting SO long for our waitress to bring us food, to bring us service etc, we talked to the \"owner\" who cared about nothing we had to say, only cared about the money. The manager did not refund us, did not give us a discount, as a first time customer here for me, and a returning customer for my wife, as she has grown up here this will be the LAST time we ever come to this place. Did i forget to mention that me and my 9 month prego wife left HUNGRY??? Even after telling the manager that we pretty much paid $70 for bread...  Yeah! We will be disputing the bill. My wife is truely hurt by the way we were treated tonight, she tried to surprise me with this \"fantastic\" place.....  Thanks for reading my review, and please remember, you can get way better service at Red lobster for the same amount you would pay here. Please contact me with any questions or concerns you may have , 480-269-1834.Used this company to cater a working lunch for my boss.  They bought 5 oz drink glasses and no ice!   Really?  This was a working lunch, not a bar crawl.  The sandwiches were average, at best.  Then the deliverer who set the lunch up left a large bag and several boxes right in the conference room.  You\\'d think for $200 they would have carried out their own garbage!  We will NOT be using this vendor again!  I would rate them and their service as mediocre at best and their delivery services as just bad!If I could give this zero stars I would. We were staying here for our wedding reception. The first moment I tried to check in and was told they couldn\\'t find our reservation. We were told to just \"stay at home since we lived in the area\". I was then told to just sit down so he could take care of other people and was ignored for 20 minutes. Eventually, we got a room by paying double even though we had a whole wedding party staying there and booked something over 6 months ago. \\n\\nNext, the bar. We stopped by after our reception (in our wedding attire), and were ignored for about 20 minutes before being told that they can\\'t make what we wanted or much else, again with a sarcastic and rude attitude. \\n\\nLastly, as we were trying to just get out of this place, we called down to see if we could get a valet to help with our bags. I was told to just get it myself and received no help. Happy to be leaving. \\n\\nOverall, this is the WORST customer service I have ever encountered. When you work in the hospitality business, you should NOT be rude, sarcastic and cold to your patrons, which was especially horrible considering the event. I will never stay at a hotel indigo again.The guy that answers the phone his name is Alexandre! He rude and annoying and have no respect to customers or to the place he works for. I have asked a simple question and all he replied back saying was \"really\" !!!!!!???!!!! It\\'s definitely a bad experience that doesn\\'t match with brand name. This message is for Dominos pizza management team please make sure you you monitor your staff!!! It is an embarrassment that you have people working like Alexandre.Do yourself a favor and go with any other cleaning service. The maids are all sweet BUT the owner is a terrible business man and does not communicate with his houses.  This week we were suppose to receive our bi-weekly clean at 10:00 on Tuesday.  The maids show up at 11:30ish and had no clue they were suppose to be here at 10. So I asked to reschedule for the following day and they were booked up (okay that\\'s fine) so then they say they will come on Thursday.  Well 10 rolls around then 11 and still no maids.  We had to contact the owner and he said one of the maids was fired \"due to her personal issues\" okay that\\'s fine but let people paying you know.  So they FINALLY come on Saturday they \"clean\" the house in about 1.5 hours (it\\'s about 2000 square feet) so they do an average job.  The cleaning was suppose to be free- well we were then charged. TRUST ME when I say it is not worth the hassle of dealing with this place.Contrary to my fellow Yelpers, I had a really rotten experience at Canteen. Canteen is an upscale Mexican bistro, located in a restored building on the east side of Capitol Square. \\n\\nWe were served circular corn puffs seasoned with cumin (I guess instead of tortilla chips) as the free appetizer. They were basically giant rice crispy cereal pieces - not exactly amazing. \\n\\nThings went downhill fast when my mother ordered the carne asada tacos. She ate most of the taco, which, by the way, tasted average. She happened to cut a piece of the beef in half. The beef was thoroughly raw and the fat wasn\\'t even melted. I have ordered medium rare steaks around the world, but this beef was completely blue/purple - it was downright unsafe. \\n\\nThe rest of the meal was mediocre-average. The refried beans were dry and stale, but the fried corn was pretty good. \\n\\nWhen I complained to the staff, we got most of our meal for free and we also got a free dessert. My mom had lost her appetite, but I settled on the churros. The dainty churros were tossed into a paper bag (I\\'ve seen better presentation at the state fair). These were the worst churros I\\'ve ever had. They were completely stale and greasy. They smelled like expired, cheap soybean oil and I had to spit out the small bite I took. \\n\\nWhen I got home (not surprisingly) I had terrible stomach pain. \\n\\nThe staff took our concerns seriously and it was nice to have a nearly-free dinner, but for god\\'s sake don\\'t go near Canteen.Most inept, lazy, carefree employees ever! 50 perfect of the time they mess up the print job.  Open file, click print... how hard can that be.  Take some pride in your job!\\n\\nKept trying to give them a chance but way too much a waste of time - time to buy a large format printer.  Suggest going elsewhere for your printing needs.I used to order here once every few months, so not much, but one time they said they could not deliver at all because they were busy.  I chose not to give them my business for a year or so.  Well now they started delivering flyers again, which makes me believe business is slow, so I gave them one last chance, bad choice, the food was less than satisfactory, one example being, I ordered war wonton soup, and received ZERO wonton.  I gave the second chance when I normally would not, big mistake!  Seals the deal for me, will never give my business again.  Wish I could give negative stars.I am probably cutting my nose off despite my face but something needs to be done about the \"LACK of CUSTOMER SERVICE\" provided by this business.  My wife and are looking to purchase a modular home located in this community.  We worked and agreed on a unit and then submitted the application along with a $250 app fee.  I understand there are some cost involved in getting these reports but I paid it and moved forward.  We were approved without any problem and I am attempting to schedule a closing date and move in.  Well today, August 3rd I find out this community will not allow us to sign the lease or move in until I can deliver to them a copy of the title for the modular home with my wife and me listed as the owner.\\n\\nI can pay for the home start paying the insurance to cover the property but I cannot sign the lease and move in until the state of Ohio issues a title with my name in it?  In the state of Ohio that can take up to 30 days.  This is the CRAZIEST THING that I have ever heard!  I called and left a message asking the park manager to call me but I would bet a large amount of money that she will not return my call.  I start my job in the Cleveland area on 9-1-16 and I am not willing to pay to stay in a hotel if I just purchased a modular home and making payments on that unit.\\n\\nSo I hope someone from Columbia Park or their parent company is paying attention to reviews and social media.  I hate to say it but if we cannot clear this up then I have to cancel the purchase of this home and look at another location.  The annual lot fee is over $6000 per year so this is a big item to me.  I will update this rating when I have more information.We love the food but are growing weary of the inability to get a take out order right. They are like 1 out of 6 on the last 6 orders. Sure, once you can deal with but now its obvious this store needs a new manager.Worst Staffing I have ever worked for.. Word of Advice:  Before you accept ANY TYPE of JOB, make sure you get it in writing or email or something because after they make the offer they like to change the rules, pay, benefits, and basically treat you like a tool..I really wanted to like this place but man was I disappointed. We went on Labor Day and before we head over my husband called to see if they were open since it was a holiday, the lady answered and said \"yes we are open\" and hung up. When we got there we were waved over to the counter so we could order our take out. The tallish girl taking our order looked miserable and angry. I asked about a menu item and what the dish contained and she literally just read the name of the dish off the menu and didn\\'t tell me what else was in it. I asked if i could substitute white rice with brown rice and she just said \"no\". She was rude and just glared at us while we went over the menu and made us feel really uncomfortable. I ended up ordering chicken with noodles and they were super salty and the noodles had a weird synthetic taste. I had to throw it in a pan at home and added some sesame oil and other veggies and spices to make it decent enough to eat. If the food would\\'ve been good I would\\'ve returned but i won\\'t return for bad service and bad food. Oh and I saw google reviews where a ton of people were complaining about the same girl I hope she reads them and fix\\'s her attitude or gets a job where she\\'ll be happy.Took my boyfriend and my sister who are big Gwen Stefani fans for a meet and greet yesterday.  Total spent was $3000.00 dollars for the 3 of us to have a good time. Well at least I thought it would be a good time. When arriving at the desk we were given 3 tickets well at least I thought. When it came time for the meet and greet we were stopped at security because we were told are tickets would not scan. When we went back to the desk no one seemed to know what was going on with are tickets as all the works scrambled around from computer to computer to try to solve what wad going on. It was at that time another employee came up and told us that if we didn\\'t come now we would miss the meet and greet. The front desk told us to go to the meet and greet and they would resolve what was going on when we get back. As we ran frantically down the long hall for the meet greet I couldn\\'t help but think about it the whole time as my partner and sister kept asking if everything was okay. After the meet and greet we returned to the desk when they told us we only had tickets for meet and greet and not the actual show. When I pointed out to the workers that our tickets said GA which stands for general admission and seat 27 they said that my ticket was a mistake and could not explain why it said that. They then basically embarrassed me again and said we do not have tickets for the show. It was at that time I handed the gentleman my credit card and paid an additional 700 something dollars to purchase seats for the show. Almost 4000 dollars later I wanted to cry from the embarrassment from the staff and unprofessionalism experienced. I did not want to disappoint my boyfriend or my sister. We also had to ask for our vip lanyards and posters or else we probably would of walked out without them. Sorry to give such a bad review but I felt like the zappos staff could of done better considering the situation was not my fault and considering the amount of money I spent to have a good time. \\n\\nDon PattersonThe first time I went the sandwich was delicious. This time I ordered the philly cheese steak with onions and red sauce. The chef was engrossed in getting the snack cakes they just ordered out. I get home and bit into the sandwich and realize something\\'s missing. I look and it\\'s just meat and cheese. I call and explain what happened and ask if I can come and get a new sandwich that I actually ordered. Now I have worked in food service and customer service for over 20 years and have never had the chef/cook get on the phone and argue about what he knows he gave me. That\\'s what happened. He says I know what I gave you. You can add extra onions at home if you want. I told him I would happily bring the sandwich in to show him so he could see what I received. I decided to call it a loss and will never go there again thanks to having to argue about what I see as opposed to what they think I was given.Although some may be swayed by the \\'interesting\\' architectural choices and ultra-modern design, I was overall not impressed with this spot. The coffee was expensive (almost two dollars more than other cafés in the area) even though the portion was small and the espresso was just decent, and the space itself was cold and uncomfortable. Even the espresso machines built into the counter, while they looked pretty cool, seemed over the top and the barista himself told me they\\'re just more difficult to clean and maintain. Although some of the nouveau riche types (which I suppose is their demographic considering the new condos across the street) may find this appealing, I\\'m not interested in paying for all the overly designed space and overly high tech equipment, especially when the product is mediocre.\\n\\nThat being said, the service was pretty nice and the baristas were welcoming, but I\\'d rather see the same nice people working in another coffee shop where the coffee is better and the bar stools have upholstery.We called to ask if they had any red Escalades because we were ready to buy that day. We didn\\'t want to wait because our other vehicle had broken down beyond reasonable repair. They said yes so we made the 30 min trip to Monroeville. We get there and they try to show us other vehicles. After about 10 minutes, we were told they didn\\'t have any red Escalades and that it\\'d have to be ordered. We walked out. Wasted an hour of driving for this crap dealership and service.Don\\'t go here. The guy pockets your money if you pay in cash (won\\'t give you a reciept) and says if you don\\'t pass your smog test you will have to pay the full fee again for retesting.\\nSuper unprofessional people.This was a total rip off!  My friends and I purchased the VIP Pool Party tour for $39 with TravelZoo.  It advertised 3 pools (Wet Republic at MGM, Liquid at Aria and Venus at Caesar\\'s Palace) but it only gave access to 2 pools and one of them was where you met to get on the bus.  So literally the bus only took us to one pool and didn\\'t even pick us back up.\\n\\nWe met at Liquid at the Aria.  We were there for an hour and then got on the party bus.  It stopped at the Vegas sign for a picture which wasn\\'t advertised and none of us cared about.  My friends and I just stayed on the bus to drink while others went out for a picture.  Then it took us to a pool called Sapphire which was off of the strip and left us there.  We had to get our own way back and never saw the party bus again.  It was a total rip off for only a 10-15 minute party bus ride.  The bus had free drinks but it was premixed Cuervo/canned beer and the ride was so short we only had time to down one or two drinks before it was over.\\n\\nLiquid at the Aria charged extra for chairs and wouldn\\'t let us even put our sandals or purses down on the ground.  We had to check them.  Sapphire was off the strip and pretty empty with not much going on.  Nothing felt VIP.  We ended up walking all the way back to the strip from Sapphire because we didn\\'t want to spend more money on a cab.  \\n\\nDefinitely NOT as advertised and NOT recommended!Don\\'t let the size of this place fool you, they lack quality of product. I\\'ve been growing and also a consumer of Cannabis for over 20 years. Maybe it\\'s because I come from different product standards in Cali, but this place sells old, dried out bud for high quality prices and after spending about $1000 every 5 days and receiving dried out bud almost every time, I finally mentioned something to the manager when I got a half ounce and it was the most dry bud I\\'ve ever seen. Her response was that she could give me 10% off another eighth. All the bud was still in the container. \\n\\nJust because they\\'re the biggest store doesn\\'t mean their anywhere near good quality - it\\'s all a hype. \\nBUYERS BEWARE: don\\'t let the size fool you. This place lacks quality. You just lost a loyal and high spending customer. Set up your game! \\n\\nBottom line, Vegas actually has some very high quality cannabis shops but this certainly isn\\'t one of them, not even close!!Meh. The only thing worse than the food here was the service..  Evertime I went for lunch it was dead (no shock). Even with no one in the place the servers were absent.. And now... Yep they\\'re closed. (Big shock).I am giving this place one star because ZERO is not an option this has to be the worst family event location. They harassed me and my children and the manager Meghann Mcbryan was using foul language around my children and then they had the nerve to kick me out for ordering pizza from somewhere else and I only did that because their food options were Terrible. I expect to hear from someone at this business because we spent good money here for some woman to insult me.I was visiting from out of town and wanted to see what was on offer here. Stopped by and grabbed a coffee, cause I\\'m always down for organic coffee. Asked for a coffee then decided an almond milk latte would be better. What did I get? A dairy milk latte. Not what I asked for, not what I wanted. I\\'ll take the drive to Luna\\'s in Charlotte next time, even if it\\'s just for a drink.On February 04, 2016 approximately 3:45pm, my daughter was involved in an accident near the intersection of Westheimer @ Sam Houston Parkway S. The other driver, Mr. Kyle Jenkins, front driver side truck hit the front passenger side and rear of her vehicle. Houston police and Harris County police were on the scene. Both police departments determined that Mr. Jenkins was at fault and he was issued a citation for his failure to change lanes safely. It has been 7 days and we continued to get the same run around responses from progressive insurance and that is that they do not know whom is at fault and no repairs will be done until then. Mr. Jorge Cordova also told me that it could be equal fault on both parties despite having both police reports of the accident. It has been long enough to determine fault and the two police reports supports the facts! Progressive needs to acknowledge fault and pay for the damages done to our vehicle or our attorney will take over completely!!!Golly don\\'t even want to give them a star\\nStay away far away \\nWent  there for our anniversary. Terrible service food cold as ice then they reheated it till it was well done I left eating nothing   I felt like we were being punked. Manager could careless and waiter said I hope it\\'s nothing I did.  I said sure it is you let our food sit on the line till it was freezing cold.I had my Jeep washed here twice, the first time they did their detailing job which was overpriced at 89.00, the treatments they put on the exterior washed off in the rain two days later leaving streaks all over the place. This last time I made the mistake of leaving a set of Bose earphones worth $145.00 on the console and an audio cable worth $10.00 on the dashboard, and the attendant doing the cleaning obviously figured they needed them more than I did. In short don\\'t trust this operation. Mesa location!HORRIBLE - DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!! Unless of course you like shoddy work done by unsupervised hooligans who will completely disregard your home or property. Hiring this company ensures you can enjoy paint chips and debris everywhere, paint over-sprays on everything, drips in your plants and lawn (not to mention the plants trampled and crushed by ladders and careless boots) and paint stains on any concrete or paved surface . The job will no doubt take at least double the time frame promised and the crew will certainly enjoy using your front lawn and patio for their \"lunch breaks\" which can run from 10am - noon and be complete with food trash, crumbs, cigarette butts and a radio so all your neighbors can enjoy the sounds of Spanish music mixed with 3-5 loud Spanish speaking men who have no idea how to paint a home. (These are unsupervised hooligans after all) You can have them do bad stucco work as well! This is a full-service horrible company. You can speak daily with the \"manager\" who will smile to your face and then ignore your concerns, never writing anything down so it can be \"checked-up on\" after completion. He will never be on the job site to supervise the crew either, but I\\'m sure calling his cell phone will make you feel better as you see things being done incorrectly. You can even speak with the owner, a well-spoken \"business man\" whose \"professional company\" is happy to not properly do any of the job you\\'re paying for. You will get a hearty apology and several assurances that \"this never happens\" and \"we hope you know the kind of person I am\" as if this is going to help remedy their poor performance by keeping in mind that the owner is a really great guy if you just get to know him.   You might even get a break on the price to make up for your troubles, which of course it won\\'t.I\\'m a Dunkin girl all the way. Love dd coffee. I usually visit the one on Gibson and 215 because it\\'s close to work. This ones by home and I\\'ve NEVER had a good customer service experience here. I literally just got asked, \"what do you expect me to do about it?\" When I informed the cashier he charged the wrong amount, the full amount rather than the perks offer amount. Then he got another girl, who said its not her fault and there\\'s nothing she can do. I was using my perks card on my phone and getting the $1.99 espresso drink and 99¢ coffee that are perks offers that I\\'ve gotten 3 times in last week at another location. I told her I wanted my money refunded and to be charged right amount. She said she refunded my money, but it didn\\'t go on the dd perks card so I wasn\\'t refunded. But she still wanted me to pay the $1.99 and 99¢ for it on top of the almost $7 I\\'d already paid for it. She said I had to pay again and call perks to have them refund the other?!? This is far from the first time I\\'ve had problems there. I guess I can only get my dd when I\\'m at work and forget any near home. This place is horrible.\\n\\nSince I refused to pay AGAIN for the same drinks she took them and threw them away. So I paid $7 for drinks I didn\\'t even get!I have been going to the O\\'Reilly auto parts store for over 5 years now on 9809 West Happy Valley Road Peoria, AZ 85383. Last night at 7:30 pm (5/6/13) my battery died yet again in my car. I purchased it from O\\'Reilly about 3 years ago an had it replaced about 14 months ago with a new battery from O\\'Reilly\\'s. I took it out of my car and brought it in, expecting to have a quick check on the battery and replaced like it\\'s always been.   To my dismay the employee said he needed to attempt to charge the faulty battery for 30 minutes while I waited in the store. I complained that this was never done ever in the past and he stated this is always how it was done.   Since the employee did not value my time over his, I was forced to wait while they attempted to charge my faulty battery. After 30 minutes he checked the battery again...and determined it was indeed faulty. He grabbed a new battery from the shelve and informed me it would be $55... I complained that the last battery did not last the 24 months and it was under replacement.   The employee informed me that the warranty was from the original date of purchase and prorated afterward. After explaining that he wasted over a half of hour of my time and other retailers such as Costco allow the warranty period to restart when you get a new replacement...he didn\\'t seem to care. He actually told me, \"well you should of bought it at Costco then\".   At that point I took my old battery back and left the store. For a company that prides itself on customer service...I could not of been found at that store that night. I ended up purchasing a new battery at Costco. Even though it cost me more upfront, I consider it a learning experience. The employee\\'s at that branch were not interested in service, only sales.   If truly this is the way the treat long time customers, I will find another parts supplier that treats there customers with the respect they deserve.Horrible concession lines. Stood in line for 40 minutes for a water. Missed entire second act. Horrible system! Never be back. Pouring a can of beer or water into a plastic cup and creating more garbage and adding to your wait. Ridiculous!I would probably give this place no stars if I could... My sales experience with JD Byrider so far has been mediocre. My car sales lady Kat told me that my payments on my car would be reported twice as much bc I make two payments in one month. THAT WAS A LIE! Not to mention I referred one of my co-workers to this place and her car sales person forgot to send in the referral paperwork so I could get my check. I had a bunch of people constantly tell me they would call me back and they never did. So I speak to BOB the sales manager and he tells me that he\\'s going to find out and call me back..   an hour later JUST GUESS ... No call back so I call again and he is the first person to answer the phone call, then he has the nerve to say he\\'s on a phone conference call and that he will call me back. I don\\'t understand if you\\'re on a phone conference call that\\'s so important why are you answering the main phone? That just doesn\\'t make any sense. I could be wrong. I will say this place is a great place to go if you have bad credit and no car! That\\'s about it.This is the worst place I have ever been to. They have terrible customer service and not enough staff. They made my mom wait an hour soaking her feet and no one ever attended to her. We walked out mad and my mom was unable to get a pedicure. They even continued to help people who came after to do their nails and kept saying it will be another 5 mins. I wish I looked at reviews before coming to this location. Heed my warning and go somewhere else!Service: excellent.\\n\\nFood: far behind all the other Indian places in the city.\\n\\nWe had a Groupon for this place.  We had been to their other location on Bloor and the food was good there, but the food here tastes far different and not nearly as good as their Bloor location.\\n\\nAppetizer: Assorted\\nMains: Butter chicken, lamb ghost\\nDesserts: Ras Malai, kulfi.\\n\\nIt\\'s not awful or the worst or \"bad\", but Indian in Toronto has high standards.  Gotta keep up with the Joneses.Sooo I\\'ve been to a few different clubs in Vegas and decided to give this place a shot. Super disappointed and left within an hour. People act like they\\'re special, it\\'s over crowded..no room to walk ... long wait for the bar... no where to sit or even dance it\\'s so crazy I can\\'t believe I\\'m even writing a bad review I never do this but I\\'m so disappointed. Clubs at Paris, Cesar\\'s, Bellagio:.. even chillin at the bars around are more legit. Music is rad but nothing else about this place is.I used to love washing my car there until they hired the young lady with an attitude!  Every single time I\\'ve been there she has had some comment to me. She is so rude to customers.Food seemed okay, service okay, my wife likes the Indian movie selection - but can\\'t recommend a restaurant with a known insect problem.don\\'t use this place - they charge way too much and do a terrible job.\\nI had a pair of jeans hemmed and wanted the original hem - they charged\\n$25 and rolled up the hem and it looked awful!!!   And the employees are\\nrude too!  I then had to go somewhere else to have them fixed right for another $20.Don\\'t bother...if you truly know Greek, there is nothing authentic about this food. You\\'ll be better off crossing the street and going to Chipotle.Absolutely horribly disgusting place to eat. I hit one star on accident and don\\'t know how to delete it. There are not enough words in the English dictionary to describe how bad this place is. The best part about this place is I didn\\'t get sick. Stay away. You\\'re better off eating out of the dumpster behind Taco Bell. And healthier for it.Don\\'t go here if you expect consistent or reasonable hours for the driving range.  It\\'s clear the goal for the owners of this course is to hammer down their expenses without any concern for the customer.Still waiting after an hour. They told us about an hour. Thirty minutes past that time and still waiting. No clue how to handle a rush of business. If not seated soon. Will never be back. No plAce is worth it. More to come..... We waited far to long. The staff was always friendly. I believe they need some one to manage the tables with more experience. It is a great place and venue. Food  was excellent as well as the appetizer. The main course came quickly. Witch still begs the question as to why we had to wait so long. It seems they are great at food, but need to invest in someone who can manage the front of house.I would not recommend Mary Ann! The first time she did my hair it was perfect! Second time - what was supposed to be a 11:00 am appointment turned out to be 4 pm since she did not write it down! Very disorganized. What should have been golden brown color turned out pitch black and the products used caused a lot of itching to the scalp! Disappointing experience overall!!!My hair was colored here last week and it came out NOTHING like how I wanted. The teacher amber was rude about me not liking it and we scheduled another appointment to have it fixed. When I got here however it turns out that the receptionist failed to actually book my appointment and the teacher failed to fill out the necessary paperwork for me to return. Now I have to see my family for the holidays all while hiding my hideous hair. Horrible school. I would not recommend this place to anyone.Wow, location is horrible!!! Scary dungeon at night- so far from McCarran car rental shuttle - out in a dusty desert field.Super long wait times - antiquated check in. Don\\'t forget your insurance card! The one star was for the actual car, which was fine. Totally not worth the few dollars you save by not renting  from a company actually at the McCarran Rental Car station- which would be a much cleaner faster and easier experience!!!!!I want to say that the customer service I received from Stephanie was fantastic.  But other than that I can\\'t say the rest of my experience was as great as she was.  I went here for the first time because I needed some hair supplies and my hair dryer broke on me and I was in a rush to get a replacement.  I\\'ve heard of Sally\\'s before so I decided I\\'d check it out.  I came to this particular location and found everything I was looking for including my hair dryer.  The day after, I went back to get an exchange for a hair razor because I purchased the wrong one.  No problem there, as it was a straight exchange.  A couple of days later, I tried to use my NEW hair dryer and it broke down after 2 uses... It was no longer blowing hot air.  WTF.. So I made a second trip to go exchange it for another one.  I exchanged a hair dryer that was cheaper than the original one I purchased and I was supposed to get a REFUND on the remaining balance, but instead the girl did a PURCHASE and charged me for the difference.  I didn\\'t realize this until my bill came in the mail saying I did purchase rather than a return.  Annoyed, I went to the store a couple weeks later with my credit card bill asking to speak to the manager on duty about this.  Stephanie, the supervisor on duty, called her manager right away and took down my information, informing me that the manager would call me the following Monday when she was in.  Monday rolled around and I never received a call, I called on Tuesday and the girl told me that she never came in for her shift and that she\\'d pass along the message to call me back asap.  A week later, no call.  At this point, I\\'m irritated and angry with the horrible customer service, especially from the manager.  I went straight to Head Office and called them to inform them of the issue and what was going on.  The process of having to refund my money onto my credit card should not take over a month!  I spoke to a representative from Head Office and she said she would have to speak to the store and look further into the situation and she\\'d call me back.  A couple more days pass by, no call.  I decided I\\'d call Head Office AGAIN.  I spoke to a representative and she said that the manager was dealing with another customer and she would get her to call me back as soon as she was done instead of putting me on hold.  I was very stern and straight forward informing her that I would be really upset if she doesn\\'t call back and she insisted she would let her manager know before she leaves for the day.  Never received a call within the next 15 minutes. I called back again, and got another representative  and told her that the manager on duty was supposed to call me back.  She went to go look for the manager and she had already left for the day!  At that point, I was livid and I expressed how I felt to the representative I was currently speaking to and she was EXTREMELY RUDE and interrupted me as I was speaking!  She even responded with \"Do you want a solution to this?..... Fant-astic!\" (In the most sarcastic voice ever).  She asked me to call my bank to ask them to reverse the charges and to let them know I didn\\'t approve of it.  So basically after waiting a month to get this sorted out, she wanted me to solve it on my own.  How f\\'ed up is that?  The next day - of course, I receive a call from the store and from Head Office again.  Both of them left a voicemail stating that they would do the refund without any issues as long as I go into the store to do it..  SERIOUSLY?  I have to make another trip to the store to do a refund??  I called Stephanie to ask her if we could do the refund over the phone and she asked her manager and the manager said no because they needed my physical card to do the refund.   So now this was going to be my fourth trip to the store.. and that will be the last time I go back to the store, PERIOD.  In fact, I\\'m done with Sally\\'s Beauty all together and I wish I had never purchased their $5 membership.Ok, how do you review a place, as your daughter is in pain, it\\'s been 2 hours now and you are stuck in the waiting room, yelping the time away just hoping that she will be next ,and you are still yelping hours later.\\n\\nI can\\'t quite bring myself to terms as to why it takes so long in an emergency room......I watch ER it doesn\\'t take this long.  \\n\\nSo in my delusional state I am in right now, I just look at all the people around, look at the pace of the staff and there is just no EMERGENCY.

I read the reviews on just-eat and other than comments about delivery times it had good reviews so I gave it a try.  Big mistake. \\n\\nHere\\'s the rundown of my order.\\n\\nGeneral Tao chicken - cold, over cooked with next to no sauce to mask it\\'s horrible flavor. Had a few pieces and the rest went to the trash. \\n\\nSushi pizza (white tune) - where\\'s the fish?  Most pathetic looking sushi pizza I\\'ve seen. The fish was paper thin and flakey.  I questioned if I should eat it but I was starving so stomach won. \\n\\nSnow dragon roll -  this also had white tuna. Same situation as above. \\n\\nBuffalo roll - this one I actually liked.  Would have been better if I could have seen or tasted some of the cream cheese that was listed as an ingredient but at least it wasn\\'t as horrible as the rest of my order. \\n\\nSo other than quick delivery time this place had nothing to offer other than the gurgling in my stomach.Selection was slim based on what I\\'m used to. Also they have lockers at the front, where they demand you lock up your bags. Makes you feel like a child. Also, the customer service left something to be desired. I asked the woman at the front of the store, how many bags of hair would I need for braids. She states, \"I don\\'t know why you people ask me how many bags you need. You guys are the one who get braids!\" Ummmm...excuse me...\"you people?\" [For reference, I am Black, she was Asian]. Well, I\\'m probably just asking you because you work in a hair store all day! Needless to say, I will not be back to this store, ever.Since moving to the area wanted to try this place... wish we never did.. over priced fry bread tasted like it was cooked in old grease and beans had no taste. . Staff not friendly no plans on returning ...This shit is ass!! Worst one yet!! Food wasn\\'t good, horrible quality! Bread looks like it\\'s on crack, not even soft or toasted. 2nd time & its ass.. only go if the other one is closedWhen I first moved in here two years ago when P.B. Bell managed, the office staff was super friendly and I felt it was worth the price. Now that Escape is under new management, I can\\'t say the same. The grounds used to be clean and office staff was friendly. I transferred from a one bedroom apartment to a two bedroom within the community a year ago. Upon inspection, the maintenance crew told me I would not be charged. The carpet was pulled up and frayed near a bedroom door and one wall had two large holes from a TV wall mount. Even still, I was told it was fine and that the carpet would have to be replaced anyway and touch ups are done before new residents move in. In the present, my lease just ended and an inspection had to be done by the new management crew. First off, Brenden was extremely rude to me while doing the inspection. He told me it was not normal wear and tear and would be at least 200 dollars to patch up the carpet. The \"damages\" in the second apartment are not as bad as the first. The only reason I did not fix the TV holes on wall and rug, is because I was not charged last time. Every time I tried to reason with Brandon he raised his voice at me and said there is no use talking to me I don\\'t get it. I recently spoke to the manager Chris Carrol and it was as if I was speaking to Brendens twin. He even tried to charge me 55 for the touch up paint for the two holes on wall when Brenden said it would only be 20. He also stated that they are good friends outside of work and said that I shouldn\\'t have made smart alec comments to Brenden. Overall, this has been a nightmare. I would not recommend these apartments to anyone and it is not worth the price. Not by a long shot. Beware the greedy management crew!!! They want to steal from residents now that everyone is moving out and no longer care to live there.My order was flooded with chocolate ice cream and it gave me a cavity. Do not recommend going here and this is not a good place to have a birthday party.At the time of year 2002, the Venetian was the top of line for me. The hotel stay was about $250 a night. I stayed with friends for about 3 nights. The room was huge having 2 queen beds and a sofa queen bed. There were 2 TVs.  One TV in the sofa area and another in the 2 queen beds area. The only issue is that if you remove or move a any items in the refrigerator, then you would be charged that rate for the removed item. I was charged a rate, in which my friend argued with them and they removed the charge.  \\n\\nNow it should be a 3 star hotel\\n\\nI have stayed at the Venetian back in 2010 and it was not well taken care of. For better rooms, you would need to stay in the Venezia or the Palazzo. \\n\\nThe rating of this room is still ok, but not as clean and taken care of as the rest of the other hotels.don\\'t go here if your a woman or don\\'t know your business and historyy of your vehicle.  they think we women don\\'t know what their talking about. michael turner recommended services on my truck that i didn\\'t need to try and upsale me and gave false information on my vehicle that i know i didn\\'t need. my truck was just serviced 6 months ago before moving to vegas. so to be sure i took it to jiffy lube and nothing is wrong with my truck. will be taking this straight to their corporate office. do your job but don\\'t lie and scheme to get more money out of people. \\nbig o tires word of mouth can either make you or break you , but it\\'s the best advertisement...Husband and I stopped in for an early lunch.  There were about 5 customers.  As we walked in, there wad a couple placing their order.  As soon as they finished, we stepped forward to order.  The girl who had been taking orders said she would be right with us and proceeded to walk about 4 feet and started slicing avocados.  Then she proceeds to stop what she was doing and decided to have a conversation with another co-worker.  Another employee walked over to where we were standing and decided that was her cue to lean on the counter and draw hearts on a piece of paper.  I asked if she could please take our order but was completely ignored.  We decided at that point we would go somewhere else.  We have been regular customers at this location since moving to AZ last year.  Horrible customer service.  Never again.I picked this airline because they have good pricing and they offer alot of benefits to the military. Well wi that said I am very upset with them. My fkight was supposed to take off at 0700 and it is now 1146. First they move gates, then the plane they move us too has a flat tire, which they find on a preflight inspection 20min before boarding? I\\'m in the airforce, we complete these checks at least 2hrs prior to flight. Then the Nav CDU craps out then they get an engine indication light. They remove and board us 3 times then ground the plane. They still dont know when or if we will get a flight out. They give us meal vouchers to use in airport, of after you get your voucher it says in the fine print that by accpeting the voucher you cant lay anymore claim to the airline. Fooled you. This airline is a joke, their planes are garbage and in top of everything else I missed my grandmother\\'s funeral. ThanksWalked in on a Friday night so we figured we would have to wait a bit to be seated and served, we waited for 20 minutes before we sat down when there was only one large party in the the resturaunt, once sat we waited 45 minutes before we left, not even a drink order or interaction with a server, we finaly decided to walk out and never come back to this resturaunt again, rude waiters, understaffed, and a very unpleasant experienceNever again. Do not waste your time or money. Not worth any perceived savings. \"Priority\" is a scam. Rip off from start to finish.Horrible.   \\n\\nWent in for a mani/pedi.   Young guy asked to do my mani & the same time a lady was doing my pedi.   Completely unrelaxing.   Nails look horrible.  They have bumps and paint on my skin.    He rushed my manicure so that he could sit in a pedicure chair and play on his phone.   \\n\\nStrongly recommend going somewhere else.This place is shut down. We\\'ve tried to visit it before. The website address doesn\\'t exist any longer, and physically drove to the location and no winery here anymore.RIP-OFF ALERT!!!!! Went for a little school clothes shopping - prices are way out of whack - jeans with holes for $18, faded out t-shirts for $2, AND THEN... went to pay for 5 magazines. A sign by the books clearly states: \"Magazines 29 cents\", only @ the checkout they were marked on the back 99 cents!!! Talked to manager who just said that\\'s their system. Won\\'t be going back. Honesty is NOT company policy.It is so difficult for me to wrap my brain around the fact that I was in a traumatic car accident and then to be verbally abused by the tow truck driver, which is what happened to me. I am so upset.  This company has a contract with the City of Phoenix, their contract should not be renewed. They are a rip off, would not tow to my house, and I had a truck full of valuable tools, DV Towing insisted my vehicle go to the yard first so they could get the fee, and then to my house.  I refused medical treatment at the scene as to not leave my vehicle with all of my expensive tools in it.  I was injured and the tow truck driver for DV towing told me to go get a rock to put under my tires.  I told him to buzz off, and then he went and complained to the cops about me!  I had just been t-boned by another driver and then have this jerk to deal with.  Needless to say, I called another company and they towed right to my house.  If I or anyone would be incapacitated and not able to express our wishes for our vehicle and the location that it should be towed to,  DV Towing would use this to collect as many yard fees as they could.  The driver was verbally abusive to me and they are dishonest.  City of Phoenix pay attention! I am going to the City of Phoenix to file or complain to whomever will listen.The sandwiches are messy. Not sure how to eat the egg sandwiches to avoid the egg exploding on your face and clothes.We ended up booking this hotel last minute because we found ourselves stranded in Vegas due to a dust storm. Unfortunately the room was just as dusted. Doors, walls, the tub ALL Dirty, no blankets on the bed, had to ask for air conditioner remotes that took forever, wifi connection was a joke. Just an all around disappointing experience.Probably the worst taste of/bite of festival I have ever been to.  The tickets are a stupid idea, the venue is cramped and the food is poor overall.   Don\\'t waste your money.Normally enjoy Loco. However on my last visit, they refused us service after we had already been seated with no good reason. The manager on duty didn\\'t even come talk to us to explain why. Real professional. All we were told by the disrespectful security guard was someone didn\\'t want us there... ? What a great way to run a buisness! I am in the service industry, and me or any of my friends will never come back or recommend this discriminating establishment ever again!Sheesh the manners of the employees here are atrocious! I\\'m not sure what kind of training they have to go through but the customer service is lacking severely! It makes you not want to order from here. And the ice cream machine is always down. For such a nice area they really need to improve this location.40 minutes for a stinking burrito, the hostess didn\\'t care and food looked and tasted horrible. First and last time.You don\\'t need to call for reservations because they don\\'t even care. When you have reservations for 10:00 am, and you have been wait for half an hour, then you ask them how long we have to wait still, the answer for them is \" I don\\'t know\". I WILL NEVER COME AND WILL TELL ALL MY FRIENDS DON\\'T COME THIS SHITY RESTAURANT.Worse experience ever! Got in there, no one came out to the counter. Waited there for about five minutes, I tried to call the store to get their attention and still no one came out. When I finally could order, I received the wrong item but just kept it moving. They gave me no lids for my ice cream(3) to go. I would rather make the drive to cold stone next time.This was my 1st time and am disappointed . My legs were not waxed neatly and left small scars on my knee and eyebrow while using the tweezer .  The one who did was v nice and friendly but wat matters most is how the Job\\'s done . I have posed two pics have a look at thatChecked this place out recently but was pretty disappointed.  It smelled like old people in there.  The ceiling and carpet was seriously out dated, like 1970\\'s outdated.  Just had an old/worn vibe, so we didn\\'t stay.  The lane area looks ok, but they should dim some of the lighting a bit, and add a few more black lights and remodel the whole interior.Worst service they never check up on you if you need more drink and food was alright. Only saw our waitress once when she brought us our food and after two pick up her check.I\\'m not sure why the reviews are so high. Perhaps it was an off night. We had dinner here last night and if felt like one thing after another. Yes, we were seated right away... at a dirty table. Ok, wiped it off, we\\'re all good. The bread basket is like something from a presliced bag from a grocery store. The caprese starter was good but they really need to take the tomatoes out of the fridge. They were cold, hard, and a bit grainy. The presentation and size was great. We both ordered the Chicken Saltinboca the procuttio was overlooked on my husbands and mine was burnt, the noodles and sauce were very salty. To their credit the food wait time was short. Our service was *terrible*. In the beginning I said to our server I would just like water, when we left my glass was completely empty not even ice in it and had never been refilled. Not that it wasn\\'t requested. When asked about dessert we declined because we just wanted to leave already. I cannot recommend this place to anyone. :(This was absolutely disgusting. I got the unchicken and waffles and I threw up within an hour. I\\'ll never come back. Service was fine but the food ruined it for me. I\\'m not one to leave anything on my plate but I could barely stomach this stuff.The meatballs tasted like rubber, the steak tartare was warm, the rice tasted like a deep fryer hadn\\'t been cleaned in 7 years. The only good thing we\\'re the French fries.... but who can mess up french fries?Went there yesterday for lunch. I ordered a crispy pimento cheese chicken sandwich. I received my sandwich in as much time as I could wash my hands and fill a water. As a matter of fact... all 4 of our food orders were just as fast as McDonalds.  Orders came out in about 2 minutes, maybe less.I took one big bite into my plump crispy chicken sandwich and I got a mouthful of raw pink chicken. It was really gross. Took it back and manager on duty offered me another meal. So I got an unbreaded chicken sandwich with avocado. That sandwich too also was handed to me in about 45 seconds. What?  Are they precooking everything here now?  Another poorly prepped sandwich with all of the avocado unevenly placed and hanging out the rear of the sandwich. This place IS NOT about QUALITY.  Rename this place to PUD with no Q for quality. People Undedicated to Quality because this place serves way too fast to be properly prepped.I Love Philly\\'s and everytime I see a Cheesesteak place I have to try it, I couldn\\'t decide between two items so I combined them add the mayo and lettuce to my Philly. WOW me! It cost me .79 to add the lettuce and I was pretty sure he didn\\'t put either on so I look and yepp no mayo or lettuce. I take it back and say \" it has no mayo or lettuce, I ordered it can you put some on please\" I always say please because you know ( spitters) and even though it is all done right in your view the area with the veggies is blocked by the lid cover. So he makes movements like he\\'s adding items wraps it up sends me on my merry way. I get home and I have a few pieces of lettuce and no mayo to go on my few pieces of meat on my I have to much bread. On the bright side I can scoot this  to the side and make a whole other sandwich with the bread that is left over. Dark side I don\\'t order food to go home and make food. Was my two bites packed full of flavor that would have me running back for another $9 bite size snack. Nooo not at all. The meat had no flavor, the onions and peppers had no flavor didn\\'t even know it could have no flavor. They did do one good thing they did wash their hands and change their gloves and use clean utensils when I said my next order had to be gluten free and she said her food was okay.So this place is great if you want to get pills for all sorts of problems. When it comes down to being a doctor, they are the worst. Miss diagnosed 3 times and let alone the prices for all their treatments. On top of that, they charge for paperwork that needs to be filled out for employer\\'s when you get sick. Over all, my doctor now. Is not a doctor at all!!!!!!Yesterday I took my husband to eat on his birthday.  Both the food and service was horrible.  I ordered a steak and they brought me out fish.  The server immediately removed my plate and let the chef know of the error.  The server said the steak would take 14 minutes to cook.  By then my husband would be done eating his meal.  So I sat there watching my husband eat his meal.  My husband ordered the blackened halibut, I took at bite and the fish was very dry and burned around the edges.  I tasted the carrots and the they were not cooked all the way, they were still hard.  The baked potato was the size of a roma tomato and it was also dry.  What a waste of time and money.  I spoke with Marie the manager and she came across as not caring and let me know that my steak was removed from my bill.  I would have been very upset had she charged me for a meal I did not eat. She didn\\'t do anything to have me want to come back.  Save your money and go to a more reputable restaurant that knows how to serve delicious meals.Ordered delivery... told 1 hour. 2 hours later, they claim they came to my work and it was closed, tried calling, and no one answered. Weird, because i work in a 24 hour hospital and the phones go through me. So had someone called or come to the door... would have seen it. Finally another hour later, they showed up with my meal. Philly was cold and stale and the fries were also cold and soggy. I\\'m sure it could have had potential but that disappointing 3 hour wait made me feel gross trying to eat it. Plus, you Shouldnt eat food that has been sitting at room temp that long.Sams club is Sams club and don\\'t expect the speedy checkout like Costco.  Poor selection of products, Slow customer service, and not to mention about their sluggish check out lines.   Someone needs to motivate the workers with higher pay and better system.  Feels like a turkey farm here....if Costco is nearby, Sams club is out of the question...My last allergy shot was in May as I was switching jobs in June and knew there would be a few weeks where I didn\\'t have insurance coverage. However I just received a bill stating I went in for an allergy shot on June 16 when I definitely did not. I called the billing company and I think they are now being flooded with calls since the office is now CLOSED. The lady at the billing agency made it sound like they were receiving many calls like mine (aka being billed for services not received).  I am also trying to get my records and serum...total nightmare!\\n\\nI did some research online and Dr. Ispas now has a full practice in Virginia....thanks for abandoning your Arizona patients!I asked for a former menu item met with no! It was a grilled cheese(cheese witch  they have,  and bacon they have, and tomato grilled cheese, they have,on grilled bread, which they have. Don\\'t go. Not worth it. Was better before. Don\\'t care about the games. Care about the care. They have none. Reboot I get it. Not caring about retention which is your annuity GET IT. Won\\'t be back. Will miss you haymaker. New GM bitched about her hours.... Really. Companied  to me about your hours and can\\'t cook a grilled cheese.... that\\'s weak. Too bad\\nSorry you have to work so many hours. I am a manager at a well known valley restaurant. It\\'s is what it is. If you don\\'t want to be there then don\\'t. Sorry to the bartender who was as shocked as me.So many times we pulled up at 7:30 quarter to 8 and they are closed giving us dagger as for looks because we want to order a sandwich it says it\\'s closed at 8 not 7:30 not 7:40 not 7:45 8 which is a stupid time for it to be closing anyway so blonde you with the ponytail a few every time you give me nasty gargoyle faceJust left after visiting during Happy Hour which is 3-7pm every day of the week. During Happy Hour we had Shrimp Cocktail and Ceviche both cost $7.95. Well drinks only $3.50 but couldn\\'t taste any liquor in them at all and I had vodka & 7 so I should be easily able to taste the vodka.\\nThe food was OK at happy hour price but not worth more. Our main problem was the waiter was a total ass literally throwing an empty chip basket right on my place setting and my lemon that was in my water came flying out onto the table. No apology was made. I see every other review here is positive so maybe he was having a bad day but it was our first visit so we won\\'t be back.MaidDay ruined my gas stovetop (stainless steel scratches) and constantly dropped their vacuum on my hardwood creating dents.  They refused to pay for damages.  DONT HIRE!!!!Most incompetent service. Food was good. Atmosphere is very nice. I would never go here again though based off the slow, bad service. It took 47 minutes for us to get our food. The table that sat down next to us after we ordered got their food first. Then the server lied and said they ordered first. Really?  An empty table ordered before we did?  We had salad and pasta!  Nothing that time consuming!  Not once between our placing an order and the moment I asked where are food was did anyone stop by and refill our drinks or check on us. After, We asked our server to split a check and they brought back two that totaled more than the original check with out any explanation. I would not recommend this place unless you are ok being forgotten and starving by the time you get food.I usually have them do a $17-20 job which is typically ok. Last week I had them do a mini detail for $99 and the job was terrible -- glass dirty, dust on console, trunk not vacuumed and door panels uncleaned. To add even more insult I paid an additional $59 for an oil change. I really don\\'t want to have to inspect my car after a car wash, but if you use this place you have to. Onto the $3 places!!!!Went to snug harbour for a 7 pm reservation and were told we had a hour wait. Asked to speak to the manager and he rudely told us if don\\'t like it to leave.!!!  Had oysters that were off.  Drinks never came. Needless to say we would never go back.  Btw. Watched the hostess taking tips which bumped us down the list.  Very expensive fish and chips. !!!!They are a terrible rental agency.  We were superb tenants for 18 months.  We always paid on time and left the property in NEW condition.  It\\'s been 28 days since we moved out, and they still haven\\'t closed out our file.  It\\'s taking them the full 30 days to return our deposit.  Every time I call or email to ask for an update on our deposit, I\\'m told the property manager is always offsite at \"appointments\".Wandered in today to watch some of the Steelers game. We ordered some spinach and artichoke dip which came out with greasy tortilla chips and was cold to lukewarm. We asked if they could heat it up and after waiting another ten minutes we were given another batch of lukewarm dip. I was starving so we stayed for some Mac and cheese which again was... You guessed it... Lukewarm. Since no bartender felt compelled to check on us at any point, we let sleeping dogs lie, cashed out and left. Will. Never. Return., I gave this place several chances, but this past Sunday was it for us.  Mind you the service was good. The food on the other hand was just horrible, horrible. The green beans are canned w/ way to much seasoning and Soggy. I ordered the patty melt and the meat felt like card board with absolutely no flavor, the rye bread was so soggy that it was stuck on the meat, but the edges where hard as a rock. This place has completely vanished from our choices to eat. ByeWaited on hold for 38 mins while I listened to a woman bartender complain about everything in her life! She answered, and told me to hold. She never came back to the phone?? What a joke!!!This bar is the manifestation of bigotry and homophobism. There is currently (1/17/16 2:30 AM) a bouncer working at Bar Madame Lee who was so disgusted by my appearance with my partner that he came up to us, asked me if I was bothering anyone (which I was not), which obviously made my drunk self angry. You may argue that I was drunk that\\'s why this event occurred, but this bouncer hired to be ready for this type of behavior. I proceeded to tell him to mind his own business. After this, he took offense from my ridiculously \"gay\" behavior and put me in a headlock, dragged me out the door, and threw me into the middle of the street. I did not fight back. After I began to get up, this homophobic bouncer took me by the head, and threw me back onto the ground. He left me alone after this. Madame Lee, if you keep this bouncer hired after this repulsive night, I will make sure that not only does your club suffer legal action, but furthermore it will enjoy no more visitors. This bouncer was of a brown complexion, probably around 5\\' 11\", and had a beard.Not worth it!!!! After getting there at 11am there was  40 min wait!! So I figured this has to be a delicious sandwich, however I was wrong!! After I ordered a bacon sandwich and turkey sausage sandwich, it totalled up to almost $19, once I went to the pick up counter I waited 10 min while people received thier order before me that were behind me in line. The lady said I dont know what happened, I received no apology!!!! I finally get the sandwiches, and it tastes like a upgraded McDonald\\'s sandwich, I definitely can make a better one. Was it edible? Yes, its only worth $5, with a ten min wait. Do yourself a favor somewhere else like the pizza place on 3rd floor.Second and last time. Sadly I had to wait for my food while everyone ate and then was served what was clearly rotten mussels. Veggies are frozen and the salads are out of a bag. Wont waste my money againThis is my first time posting to Yelp despite using it on my constant travels, but this experience warranted it. Whatever you do, do NOT get the brisket here. If you\\'ve ever had brisket anywhere else you\\'ll be sorely disappointed. If Guy himself ever walked in and tried the brisket they\\'re serving, he\\'d rip his name off the sign and burn the building to the ground. Everything else I saw looked delicious, just avoid the brisket. Save your $34!!!This location deserves a 0 stars!  Awful just awful!  Cannot fathom that they can\\'t put together a 6pc nugget happy meal and forget the damn nuggets!  Seriously?  The employees are always fighting with each other or on their phones and could give 2 sh$ts!  Management needs fired because it never gets better!  Drive thru order last week, 3 items should\\'ve been in the bag and they forgot the double hamburger.  Awful just awful!I wanted to like this place after reading reviews but I was severely let down. It took almost ten minutes to be greeted by our waiter, who did not come over until I had to wave him down. Chips and cheese came and the cheese was thin and cold. Enchiladas came cold and without the steak as advertised. Had to wave for the waiter again to bring the steak which came cold to no surprise. A gray piece of shoe leather in which I wish didn\\'t come at all. Never again. Worst experience at a restaurant in years.Just had such a ridiculously terrible experience here. Our waitress, Penny, extremely neglectful until the end of the meal when she paced back and forth in front of our table a record number of times compared to how scarcely we saw her while eating. \\n\\nFirst off, she took 2 other orders before ours even though we were sat before both those tables and were ready to order. Menus closed and everything. Next while taking our order she didn\\'t write it down (which isn\\'t a smart move in a restaurant with such a large menu) and got BOTH of our orders wrong. My friend asked for fruit, and was given hash browns. And I was not only missing avocado, but even though I emphasized to have my caramelized onions well down they came out almost raw.\\n\\nShe kept doing this extremely irritating thing where she would drop items and run away and not even give her paying customers an extra .3 seconds to ask her for something. When our wrong food arrived, once again, dropped and ran away. Waited almost 5 min for her to come back. She told my friend to just keep the hash browns while she just grabbed her fruit, and went to go have my omelet remade. I left my barely touched, incorrect omelet on the table edge with untouched potatoes (theres a difference between potatoes and hash browns here. They\\'re two different sides) so finally my new omelet arrives, with no potatoes on the plate, yet she takes my incorrect plate, which had my potatoes, and doesn\\'t come back with another side of potatoes for me.... potatoes that I paid for. So basically, I was served an omelet with no side and was forced to eat the cold, soggy hash browns that she didn\\'t bother removing from the table when they came incorrectly with my friends meal. Nice.\\n\\nDon\\'t see her, doesn\\'t check in till almost another 10 minutes even though I see her wandering around the restaurant. \\nWhich was crappy because my second omelet was gross. Yes, the onions were finally cooked, but the whole omelet was burnt and dark brown, plus THE ENTIRE THING WAS CHEESE AND TOPPINGS. I picked around it and basically left an uneaten, picked at scramble mess on my plate in front of me, obviously it was clear I didn\\'t like it, and not a single inquiry from her as to why I barely touched my food. Every single thing about my friend and I was screaming that we were dissatisfied. From body language, to how our interactions with her changed throughout the meal, to the most obvious red flag which was that I barely ate anything. Then she leaves that mess in front of me till after she drops the check which took her 15 more minutes  (she did the classic run and drop without a word so we didn\\'t even have the chance to complain). Aka I had these dirty plates in front of me till after we even payed. Which was when she was pacing back and forth in front of us straight up staring at us as we placed our money down. When she finally collected the plates she goes \"you done?\" Then grabs the dirty plates AND my drink that I payed $6 for that had almost half left in it, and runs away. Yes penny, I\\'ve been done with this terrible omelet for almost a half an hour, but no, I was NOT done with my barista beverage. At the end of the meal we purposefully sat, and I counted 7 times that she paced back and forth in front of our table staring at the checkbook which was in a place where she couldn\\'t grab it. It\\'s crazy how her presence improved once the money was involved. \\n\\nTo top it off, there was a man sitting at the high top on a laptop, who I assume to be a manager or someone of authority because employees were discussing business with him. He was faced directly at our table, less than 10 feet away, and didn\\'t once notice our dissatisfaction. Terrible. \\n\\nI paid $30 to sip half of a drink, eat 3 bites of cold, soggy hashbrowns, and to pick through a mountain of swish cheese and burnt, scarce egg.\\n\\nMy friend and I have both been in the restaurant industry for almost 7 years. This was by far the most expensive and dissatisfactory meal we\\'ve ever had the burden of paying for. Penny had so many opportunities too, that is the worst part of this situation. She could have taken it upon herself to read our body language, acknowledge that fact that I didn\\'t touch my food, taken 2 extra seconds to actually SPEAK to her guests and we would have been back and tipped her well for her efforts.\\n\\nAnother ironic part of the situation is that this was my friends first time here, and we were scouting for a nice, slightly upscale restaurant to host/cater a baby shower brunch for about 30 people.\\nFor 2 of us our bill was $50, imagine having a party of 30. You do the math. That\\'s a lot of business you just lost.\\n\\nBut sorry BLD, there\\'s no chance we\\'re coming back here.Your service may be good but your shuttle drivers are crazy. They cut me off and almost everyone in front of me speeding up the 427.  A shuttle is billboard with your name on it. And it\\'s a bad representation of your brand.*Red flag when the pharmacy technician confuses acetaminophen for psudoephedrine. \\nSo dropped off a prescription at 2pm on Thursday was told 1 hour. Went back at 5:30 and was told that the prescription was written wrong and that they need to get a hold of our doctor but since it was after 5 there was nobody in the doctor\\'s office. Why they waited until 5:30 to call is frustrating as well as not calling me to let me know. Now it\\'s Friday 1:45 p.m. and they still have not contacted the doctor and im On my way out of town without my daughter\\'s meds.Worst experience I\\'ve ever had with a restaurant. Theresa was our  waitress and was nice at first, but all she did was take our order and drop off the check. No refills, no checking up, nothing. Then I woke up the next morning with food poisoning from my  chicken. Thanks IHOP.came in to do a smog since the regular place I go to is closed on Sundays. Was told that there will be 2cars a head of me so I decided to wait. Next thing it was 2more cars ahead of me. Yeah probably will never come back. No customer service at all. Not to mention that it took one of the guys litterraly 5mins to do an oil change. Hmmmmmm??Well.  Based on the great reviews I walked a mile over here from my hotel.  And it was a whole lot of CLOSED.  Sunday night at 8:20.  Not sure what the deal is.  So.  Be warned!!I agree with Ashley - the furniture looks nice (1 star), their attention to customer service is horrible (0 stars).\\n\\nMy wife purchased an item off the floor and ordered 2 others.  After she spent over $5K in the place she was informed that NO ONE in the store would help her load the heavy object into her car - she had to solicit another customer as a volunteer while staff in the store sat and watched.  Strike one.\\n\\nOur item arrived (dining table and buffet) but the buffet was missing shelves.  We called the store to resolve and the person on the phone stated \"I\\'ll check into it and call you right back\" then hung up without taking our name or any other information, so it was obvious he had NO intention of resolving the issue.  Strike two.\\n\\nWe called customer service and the store again and were told the item would be sent to us via UPS later that week.  After additional calls to the store, THREE WEEKS later they arranged for their big delivery truck to deliver two measly 16 inch X 22 inch shelves.  When the delivery man came he only had ONE shelf and no shelf supports to actually load the shelf into the unit.  A trip to the store to resolve this issue was met with a careless \"we\\'ll have to order the shelf supports for you.\"  Strike three.\\n\\nMy advice - stay away from this place.This owner told my friend that he didn\\'t like her because of the color of her skin. I would not recommend this business to anyone in the area. His behavior was bigoted and unacceptable.B-A-D. My wife and I were confused, because we researched restaurants online and saw multiple good reviews of The Standard.\\n\\nThe food was completely and totally mediocre. Fast food Italian. \\n\\nPlus, we were abandoned by our waiter. I had to ask someone else for pepper and cheese for my pasta, and I had to chase him down to settle our bill.The food was literally not fit for consumption, the chicken I was given was grey, and didnt even have the decency to cover my chicken katsu with the sauce It was desperately missing. Fifteen dollars for a plate of awful fried chicken sitting on top of some measly pieces of lettuce with no rice? If you like over priced food that might kill you if you eat it, this is the place for you!Spoon is an experience one must try. The atmosphere is lovely. I have to be honest though ...during restaurant week the service was rather horrible. I understand they have a lot on their plate serving a crowd of people. The food was nothing higher than average. I got the hanger steak special .. It came out cold and was very tough. The 1st course was a pot roast served on noddles and it was cold as well. The cheese board, wine, and bread were great! In addition the spoon bar for dessert was just okay. The topping chocolate part just tasted like a fudge Popsicle. Overall none of the dishes really stood out. I was surprised because most places for restaurant week go all out .My husband, daughter & I were discriminated by a man named Ariel aka Papa since we were hispanic because he came to our table to take our order whenever he felt like it didn\\'t bother telling us the daily specials or came to our table to see if we needed anything  & if it wasn\\'t for the guy who was getting the tables ready for the next customers we would of never gotten our salads or soup. Ariel aka  Papa came up to every table & gave them excellent service & made sure had everything they needed. We were discriminated by an Argentina Man who spoke Spanish & we left him no tip for the shitty service he gave us. The manager was nice gave us cappuccinos to go & ice cream for our daughter.I am so bummed ... I ordered off here based off of the reviews. I did a to-go order and did the vegetable fried rice , Kung Pao Chicken , and Mongolian beef . The chicken was so rubbery it was not even edible , the beef had some flavor and some piece were ok but others were rubbery . The fried rice was blah . $40 and honestly Panda Express would have been cheaper and better . So sad . The one star is for how awesome they packed the food , it was double wrapped !!Literally the worst costumer service I have ever had... we walked up this morning to get a table and the hostess asked us if we had a reservation and we told her no. She said \" Its Saturday sweetie you can\\'t go to brunch in Vegas without a reservation, we don\\'t have any tables available\". We could clearly see there was about five tables open right behind her and she didn\\'t ask or offer to put our name on the a list. She just said there was no tables... I will never go back to that place after this. Seriously so rude.This place is very unimpressive I\\'ve had better tasting Chinese food at Panda Express or any other fast food Chinese hole  in the wall.\\n\\nEverything was just a bunch of watery vegetables with a few pieces of meat or shrimp. Every dish no matter what it was tasted the same and looked the same. Boring tasteless food.Ordered a 16 camera in Oct 2013. With in a year the dvr died. It was under warrenty and was replaced but with a different model that was cheaper than the origional. Now this one\\'s hard drive is grinding and has no pictures on the monitor. I called Loren and they said there was nothing the can do because the 1 year warrenty has passed. I thing that the second dvr should have been warranted for a year. I personally think a system should last much longer than a year. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY. THEY DON\\'T STAND BEHIND THEIR SHITTY PRODUCTS.Didn\\'t care for food at all. Dumplings and spring rolls were tasteless. Vegetables were drowned in sauce and fish very over cooked. The service was also too fast. They served entrees while we were eating apps.Worst food ever!! We went here last night and I never had such horrible Italian food and so over priced!  The sauce is so sweet and the portions very skimpy. My daughter got the Mac and cheese and it looked like dry noodles in a bowel. We asked for more sauce and they brought us sauce that tasted like sweeter condensed milk with cream. The bread was dry and stale. They only bring you four pieces and exactly for small pats of butter.\\n\\nThe service was terrible! Our waitress was running the bar and the tables all around us. Every time we asked for something it took 15-30mins to receive it. The hostess brought us more things then our waitress. I see this place going out of business real soon!! Just awful!!There wasn\\'t one specific thing that made this buffet so horrible... It\\'s just the accumulation of everything being less than average quality. There are plenty of options, but none of them were flavorful, hot, or worth filling up on.\\n\\nSome others have commented on the dessert section being worthwhile, but to us everything tasted unthawed and on the stale side. The Asian section had probably the best offerings but all were still fairly bland.\\n\\nThe worst part is that when I was going to grab a slice from the pizza station, someone had placed the tongs directly on TOP of the pizza... So all the hand germs were in direct contact with the food! There were two workers right there who didn\\'t think this was disgusting.. I would have discarded the slices.\\n\\nMy husband and I both left with unsatisfied stomachs and looked forward to the second dinner we would have a few hours later at a much better establishment.Would have been a cool bar but.... I went to the gold spike with coworkers on a business trip.  I was allowed to enter and they checked my bag on the way in.  After I was there for 2 hours I was approached by security and they told me I need to leave because of my bag.  I told the security employee, who was just doing his job, that he checked me on the way in and he can check me on the way out.  He told me that he was \" being nice\" to leave me into this regal establishment.\\n\\nReally, \"Being nice\" ? Such a cheese ball line, and also it was insulting and  short of being an all out accusation.  Business owners like these are childish who unprofessional.  I hope the real owner of this company realizes what ammeter novices the  have working for them.\\n\\nI arrived with 14 people, we left because the management harassed me. What kind of businesses owner kicks someone out due to being inside an establishment that allowed them to enter?I\\'m not sure what I was expecting from Artisano but I didn\\'t really get much. We both ordered the lunch combo and a coffee, which cost $29. The half sandwich was about a half cup of chicken salad and all bread! They called this a gourmet sandwich - what a joke. The Kale Super salad was small soggy and tasteless. My salad was just ok. \\nI would never go back.Used the Yelp 10 for 20 deal. For that, I was able to get a 3-piece dark meat with 2 sides, and 1/4 white meat with 2 sides. First, the chicken was dry, specially the chicken breast. My friend had difficulties cutting into the breast, although we were using plastic utensils, but still... it\\'s not like we\\'re cutting into a piece of bone. Next the sides. We got mixed fruits, corn, mac n cheese, and caesar salad. The corn was straight from the can, they only added step was to warm it up. The mac n cheese was ok - tasted like it was made from the box. Two good things about this place, good serving size and garlic ranch. Thank goodness I bought the yelp deal, I would have totally regretted it if I paid for the food full price. I don\\'t think I\\'ll ever go back.Save yourself some time and frustration. The left hand has no idea what the right hand is doing. Horrible experience. Use a local Mortgage Company. I will never apply with this company again.They closed over half an hour before the posted time. Super disappointed we didn\\'t get to eat here.Service was soo poor. People who came in after us ate and left. Another group was half done eating when we inquired about our food. When the waitress came back from checking we were told they just put it on the grill. We told her we were leaving. The last time I ate here the service was slow too. It seems that REGULARS slips get to jump the line. Just saying. Went to Eat N Park from order to food (they were busy too) was 16 minutes.The WORST Neurologist doctor in all of Las Vegas. I waited 1 month for this appointment and was referred by my main Doctor via Insurance. I will ask my general Internal medicine Doctor to STOP referring patients to this quack Dr. Morton Hyson. \\n\\nUNPROFESSIONAL ATTITUDE AND HE TALKED DOWN TO ME AS IF I DID SOMETHING HORRIBLE. \\n\\nDr. Hyson consulted with me all of 4 minutes and refused to let me explain what my issues are. He cut me off every time I spoke dismissing my concerns. He actually argued with me over the meaning of paralysis. He is very mean, rude and arrogant.\\n\\nI am concerned if he is really an educated doctor, anyone can throw up some wall doctorate plaques and rent an office.\\n\\nMy visit was unproductive as my concerns and issues were not addressed and I was not given the opportunity to talk about my health or recent problems.\\n\\nHe walked off as I was ushered to the front to schedule another appointment. I said NO! I won\\'t be scheduling another appointment because I won\\'t be back and never want to see him again.\\n\\nHe walked by seeing me in tears, I told him I am disappointed and VERY unhappy with our 5 minute visit. I told him he was rude for cutting me off and not allowing me to address my concerns. I said why on earth would a real \"doctor\" sit there an argue with a patient? He replied,\"I am busy and a lot of people like me\". \"He said we can go back in the room and he will listen now\" I replied NO, I want to get as far away from you as I can. I left in tears and crying uncontrollably. \\n\\nI was devastated when I sat and read his bad reviews in the waiting room after checking in. I did not choose this doctor it was a referral so I had no choice. \\n\\nHe lives up to his bad reviews! His personality is as lively as a dead flower. I don\\'t expect personality but don\\'t abuse me by shushing me when I am trying to give you important details of my health problems. \\n\\nI am going to file a FRAUD claim with my insurance if they bill because he did not consult or treat me.\\n\\nThis man is extremely mean and arrogant.During dinner a cockroach crawled up the wall right next to our table. The service was horrible! The bruschetta was bland and one of our pizzas were burnt and had to be sent back. The margarita pizza tasted like it had canned tomato sauce on it. At the end of dinner, I went to use the restroom and it looked as though it had not been clean in months. It\\'s in a great location with great potential but the owner/manager is not doing their job. This place was a complete let down!This place is a slave camp and so unprofessional. Mgmt participates in favoritism. The HR department is a joke. Mgrs sleeping with staff members...This place has BUGS. I saw on one the wall when eating and killed it and reported it to the manager. Got my meal free however i will not be going back.Run.... the people working there hate there jobs and they don\\'t care if you like it or not, the pizza isn\\'t wroth it, every topping is like $4.00 or something crazy like that... if their busy be prepared to wait... smhI would have to say I had the worst experience visiting this property. The assistant property manager was so unprofessional. As we walked through the door she did not even acknowledge us. One of the other leasing agents informed us that she was off and that we needed to wait for the Assistant Manager. The apartments are so awkward. They are so small. If you have the opportunity to view others properties do it.I purchased a print from a catalogue that was roughly $60 and was told it would be delivered from their supplier in no more than two weeks. It has now been on the verge of two months and have been calling this place every week to get more information on where my print is. I call and ask the owner to call me back, and she never does. Im pissed, but I\\'m just left to assume she is busy dealing with other irate customers who have already paid and are waiting extraordinarily long for their prints or frames. The customer service here is zilch to none. Very quick to take your money, and slow to call you back when it takes 4 times longer than you expect to get what you have already paid for. NOT ONLY would I never recommend this place to anyone, but would call this place a fraud, and verge on calling the authorities on them. I don\\'t know why this place is still in business, and hope that it doesnt last much longer.I recently took my laptop in for a dignostic which was overpriced and I ended up buying a reconditioned netbook. I got an Aspire One for $299. Turns out its really slow and OVER PRICED! I got home and looked it up online and it\\'s  only $289 at Walmart BRAND NEW. Come on people it doesnt take a genius to figure it out. Brand new is cheaper than used. Ridiculous right. I was gonna return it and get my money back but Im pretty much stuck because when I checked my receipt, it says there\\'s a restoking fee of 25%. That\\'s $75+ of a lost!!!! I feel ripped off and will not be returning to that store anytime soon. Another unhappy customer for Laptop Xchange.The absolute WORST apartment complex I have ever lived in. Moved here from out of state. Hoped to find a decently priced apartment until I got myself settled in. Wow this place has been trash. Landlord is only here half the time, so those of you with a full time job, forget ever trying to communicate with her! Doesn\\'t answer the phone or call back. Place can\\'t even get with the 21st century and splurge on email communication. Rent past due? Noise complaint on an animal? Anything, Don\\'t worry, you\\'ll be singled out with a cheap ass piece of paper taped to your door for the whole complex to see. As far as CAM Properties as a whole, also trash! They also refuse to give callbacks. After hours \"emergency?\" ha, yeah right! Scottsdale PD had to be called when I had troubles after hours because CAM\\'s \"emergency after hours hotline\" didn\\'t answer the phone! I will never ever recommend anyone live here. The bugs invade the units like crazy - cockroaches, spiders, lizards, you name it. They say they spray before you move in, but do not perform any follow up procedures. They tell you if there\\'s bugs in you apartment, that\\'s all YOUR fault. Ha! I cannot get out of this place fast enough. The only upside is the utilities are included, however the price is still absurd for the less than average amenities and the horrible customer service.I saw the other reviews and thought - I\\'ll try it- I came for lunch - first of all the loud obnoxious television was too much - stupid games shows in Spanish - you just can\\'t get away from it- forget conversations with friends - terrible decor and the service was bad - part of my lunch order was with chips and salsa - never got it - the beer arrived after the tacos - NOT what the other reviews said at all!  Won\\'t be back - try somewhere else - the carne asada tasted tainted and really after everything else??  Plus it is 103 degrees outside and no a/c and no ceiling fans turned on!Terrible service, terrible prices, terrible bar!  Went there with my cousin, his girlfriend, my brother and his wife and had an awful time.  First off, who ever heard of paying cover for entering a bar?  The women went in for free but us guys had to pony over $20 just to get in this place!  Second, no one greeted us or offered us seating, more like we were herded in.  The decor is ok, nothing to write home about.  The clientele leaves a lot to be desired: think Jersey Shore rejects and Ed Hardy wearing douchebags.  After maybe 30mins, we wanted to get the hell outta there. Final verdict: don\\'t bother!\\n\\n*UPDATE*\\n\\nI was around the area and was glad to see this atrocity of a bar have shut down!  No surprise due to their lousy service and attitude.  Good riddance!*Super pricey!!! They changed us $80 to change air filters, when you get get it done at auto zone for $20I find the defensive nature of the dentist to any sort of negative feedback or suggestion to improve patient care completely off putting. I\\'ve never seen an owner on Yelp \"fight\" with negative reviewers.Tahoe Springs refuses to close my account after a disagreement in charges. They have left letters stating they will report me to the police if I do not pay and return equipment. They have left these letters on my door for neighbors to see. The letters say I have stolen their property. Others letters state I will have my account reported to the Credit Bureaucracy. They have charged me every 2 weeks although I have not received services nor had \"delivery attempts\" at my home for a year (+/-) . The driver would text me begging for payment. The company refuses to stop emailing. I feel very harrased and uneasy going to the company to deliver their equipment. Due to the hostility and overall unprofessional experience, we left messages asking them to come pick up equipment  (since they are billing for travel) and I would get a receipt the equipment was returned. They never responded but still harass me through sending invoices with bi-weekly increased amounts. I asked via email to stop contacting me, report me to the credit bureau, and close my account. They responded saying they will continue to charge me unless i pay my balance. I stopped payment because I did not agree with the charges. I am pleading for help.My husband and I walked in there for lunch and stood at the counter for 10 minutes. We were the only people in line. There were three young men working in there and only one acknowledged us. He kept saying be right with you. He never took our order so we just walked out. I guess we will give our business to a restaurant that wants it.I have been to a lot of events in many cities across the United States and this venue is one of the poorer facilities I have been too, almost exclusively because of experience.\\n\\nThe entry into the venue left hundreds waiting out in the cold until after the show started due to excessive security scanning, an understaffed crew and slow ticket processing. Once inside the poor stair lighting and aisle marking made it very difficult to find our seats. We missed 50% of the show we came to see despite arriving 30 minutes prior to show time. Will not go back here for anything.This Motel 6 location is just terrible. My husband and I, plus our two dogs, had just completed a 4 1/2 day move from San Diego, and this was to be our final hotel stay before we moved into the house. We booked this motel about a month in advance, and I had no qualms about it, because I\\'ve stayed in MANY Motel 6\\'s and never had a bad experience-until now.\\n\\nWe knew as soon as we pulled up that this motel was not going to be great, but we were tired and just wanted to get out of the car. There were kids all over the place running and screaming without supervision, and more than one sketchy-looking trucker hanging around being creepy. I went inside and got our room key. The front desk at this location looks like its a family living room behind the front desk, and although the gentleman who checked me in was pleasant enough, I just had a bad feeling.\\n\\nWe got to our room, opened the door, and were just shocked. We had asked for a nonsmoking room, and even though it had a nonsmoking sign on it, it absolutely reeked of cigarettes. The beds were stained, sagging, and looked like they might be crawling with something. Besides the cigarette smell, there was some sort of other odor in the room; I can\\'t put my finger on it. Musty, maybe. It was just bad, and as I said, I am not picky with motels at all. We decided that we just could not stay here.\\n\\nLuckily there was a La Quinta across the streets that accepted dogs, so my husband went back inside to get a refund. He said there was no issue getting the refund, and it seemed like the man had done it frequently. The La Quinta was much better.\\n\\nDo yourself a favor, and stay away from this Motel 6!It has been nearly a month (since jan 2nd 2013) since I signed up and asked for a return and still no notice as to a refund. I have been calling twice a week since and Debra has not ever returned any of my phone calls or refunded the money back. I don\\'t think I will be receiving my money back :( THEY ARE SCAM ARTISTS!! Don\\'t join any of their schools In Scottadale Mesa or Peoria!!!So it\\'s been over 25 mins and my food has yet to arrive. In terms of service and cleanliness this restaurant is much less desired. There are stains towards the back of the register counter and though I didn\\'t dine-in appears they give you a bowl of water to wash your hands w/ soap- definitely unsanitary. \\n\\nNow after finally receiving my food after 25 plus minutes of waiting it was not as I expected. The goat meat was on the tougher end and sauce that was provided was less desired. Also for $12.50 for an entree, I figured they serve quality type of ingredients. The sauce did not taste fresh at all. Nevertheless if your willing to wait, eat tough meat, and pay more than what it\\'s worth give this place a try!The menu they show here on yelp does not match their true menu prices are at least three dollars more than what is shown on the menu that they have on here their online menu and the menu pictures do not match what they have listed on their yelp!So bad. We\\'ve given this place 2 tries. First was junction rd. the service was horrible and the food was mediocre. We did not like that we couldn\\'t order our burgers to the temp of our liking. \\nTried the one in Verona. Again, horrible service and food was dry and disgusting. Dairy Queen has better burgers and quicker service! We will never be back unless it\\'s for a beer.I have to say that I was just appalled by the attendants in the show. This was a very fun loud amazing show and everyone was dancing and clapping and singing along to the show. Why my self, partner, and best friend was pin pointed out as being to loud is beyond me. It\\'s sad to say I will never go back even though the show was amazing. I felt discriminated and humiliated that they can dismiss us from a show for being too loud. I am a 45 year old woman and my partner is 55 and you are really going to kick us out like we were little kids that wouldn\\'t behave.. I am not al all a negative person but this was way out of line and uncalled for.This place is literally the WORST! Don\\'t go here. Service is awful! I should have listened to all the other reviews.I can remember being in Gus\\'s when I was too young to go to the restroom by myself.  It was a regular in my life as we lived on Commonwealth, so we\\'d eat at Gus\\'s all the time and I\\'d get 13, 6 and 11 as those numbers meant beef tips, mashed potatoes and AMAZING fried squash.  \\n\\nI\\'m now 38 and still live very close by, but Gus\\'s is SO not the same place that it once was.  The building is filthy, outside and inside.  The servers are sub-par and the food simply isn\\'t worth eating...  I ride by twice a day and miss my beloved 13, 6 & 11.\\n\\nHEY! - OWNER OF GUS\\'S!!!  PLEASE CALL GORDON RAMSEY TO COME GET GUS\\'S BACK ON IT\\'S FEET!!!  even if you don\\'t give a damn about it anymore- we local\\'s out here do still care and want to give you our money!  Please ask for the help you so clearly need.Unfortunately, this administrative fee will prevent me from ever going back.  It\\'s sad b/c I feel the care was really great.Keep walking.. $23 sandwich and stand in line for 1 toilet! Waitress is either hung over or hates her job! If you\\'re going to pay this much at least have decent restrooms! I used the men\\'s restroom because a line for women\\'s. The staff told me to go to Casino and use the bathrooms there. Do Not Come Here!I went in after being sick for 6 days and feeling worse they gave me a strep test and told me I didn\\'t have strep she didn\\'t check in my ears or my nose even though I told her I had congestion and sinus pressure and sent me home with nothing now 9 days later and I\\'m completely miserable I\\'m going to CVS Minute Clinic because it\\'s only $15 for me I will never go back here again even though it\\'s right around the corner from my houseThe poorest managed small airline in the U.S. I need to cancel my flight and called CS number. I called three and waited more than 30 mins and no one picked up the phone. Their airline is not cheap at all. Consider the high possibility of delay and poor customer services.My macbook pro recently had some issues with loading to the desktop after I attempted to update to the new system, so I brought it into the Illini Union Tech Zone asking if they could fix it. \\nIt took them three full days to get back to me with the diagnostic test results, which cost me $30 (non-refundable). In the diagnostic results, they claimed that my hard drive was failing and needed to be replaced for $140 and to recover data that\\'s an extra $120, they also recommended a battery replacement for $134. I didn\\'t have time to wait for them to order a new hard drive and have it shipped, so I decided to bring my laptop back to the local apple store and let them take a look.\\nThe local apple store ran a diagnostic test, fixed my laptop and installed the new system for me within 2 hours for $0. That\\'s right, $0!\\nKnowing that the Illini Union Tech Zone carries mostly apple products, it\\'s honestly quite surprising to see that their technicians don\\'t seem to be as familiar with the products as they should be? And they\\'re giving poor, costly advice to students.\\nI wouldn\\'t go back there again. BTW, I asked the apple technician and he said it would only be $100 to recover data.\\n\\nTLDR: Check out other places before you come here to get your laptop/macbook fixed, the fees are outrageous & the technicians don\\'t seem as competent.We ordered two Chai lattes $8.00...one was lukewarm at best and the other was cold. We will never go back!!The food was disgusting the chow main was burnt and I went up to get it replace with more burnt chow main, they seen that I was upset and they didn\\'t even apologize don\\'t come here it\\'s a waste of moneyAs part of a bridal party at Wedgewood I would NEVER have my own ceremony here! From the start of wedding day till the end it was a horrible experience. We were always being rushed by our coordinator whenever she was around but most of the time we couldn\\'t even find her when we wanted to. We were running around like chickens with our heads cut off because we didn\\'t know where to be or what to do when because she was no where to be found. The decorations were lacking cheap and minimal. We brought a ton of our decorations which helped but don\\'t rely on them. This was a horrible wedding for our bride who was miserable and cried multiple times throughout the night. Beware do not get married here! Worst wedding I\\'ve ever been in and I\\'ve been in 7!Kathy and Laura on staff are extremely rude and dismissive.  I will never set foot in this venue again.\\nTo treat vendors like they are servants and somehow beneath them is disgusting.  I have never in my life been talked to or treated as badly as I experienced at Spanish Trails.  Apparently, this is Kathy\\'s known reputation around town.  Yet, somehow she still has a job.I will rate this establishment due to their process in getting people to come buy a timeshare. They tell you the process will last 2 hours. We were there for 3.5 hours and some of the people told us they had been there for 5 hours. They started off by offering us a deal for 44k, then 15k, then the last offer before we actually got to leave was for 5K. At the end of the day, we waited for 20m for a shuttle to come and pick us up and it never showed up. Many of us took an uber instead. Funny- they were so ready to get us there on time but zero courtesy in getting us back home on time. The sales guys doesn\\'t even give you a chance to think about the offer in private. They are just nonstop yapping. I feel bad for the people who actually stay here because it would be a pain in the butt to deal with tons of people they\\'re trying to scam coming in and out of the building! Even the goodies you guys gave us were a joke. There were many different rules the casino told us about when using the chips. You guys are a**holes. Go get real jobs. Who the hell comes on vacation to spend 40k without given the time to research or discuss with families?I had a watch repaired here. When they gave me the watch back I noticed the second hand was not set correctly. I was told by the older gentleman he did not \"feel comfortable fixing it again that it was working but he doesn\\'t know what happened.\" So he completely ignored the warranty that they say they provide and didn\\'t fix the watch. But they did take my money which makes them frauds and cheats. So if you need help with a watch go some where else. This shop is not trustworthy.Coming from the East Coast, visiting an In-N-Out Burger is quite the treat. When in California and Arizona, I\\'m there. AND...... whenever we go to Vegas, our first stop off the plane is to....you guessed it. They are quite packed in Vegas so we always have a Plan B and Plan C location to fall back on. Imagine my amazement when I found out that this burger haven now has a location right off the Vegas Strip. It is officially listed as at The Linq, but is right around the corner from The Flamingo Hotel in the alleyway leading to the Giant Ferris Wheel. Now we were able to walk there after checking into our hotel. As with other locations, the crowd was plentiful but the young staff was quite efficient in filling the orders and getting the food in your hands in a reasonable time. My wife in the meantime secured a nice table outside. So, that\\'s where the good review ends with the pleasant and efficient staff. They get the one star that I have awarded. As for the food......my love of all In-N-Outs has come crashing down to earth. I ordered my usual Double-Double and Fries. The burger which is usually juicy, was cooked beyond recognition. It was horribly overdone and I actually threw it out after eating half of it. My wife\\'s was the same. Now, they can\\'t also screw up the freshly made Fries, can they? Yes they can and they did! These Fries were so overdone, charred and dried out that they were like those dry straws you buy in a bag or can. How can they mess up what every other location has brilliantly delivered? I hope I\\'m not scarred for life, but for sure will never visit this location again. Hopefully it was an off day, but I won\\'t be around to find out. Back to Plan B & C.Agree with other reviews- avoid this company if you can! Over an hour in line and still waiting... won\\'t be surprised if they\\'re out of cars when I get to the front!I would give it no stars if it was an option. Saw a roach on the wall and the guy at the register said \"better on the wall\". Food was ok, butter chicken so so.waited almost a month for a microwave because the cabinet spacer was unavailable, turns out the reason it was so hard to get is it was the wrong spacer for a different appliance.  Add to it the very unpleasant woman at the register that the sales guy passed us off to.  Add to that they didn\\'t call when they flaked on the first delivery, called 1/2 hour into the window the second delivery to say they are going to flake,  the third time took all morning at my house to find out the unpleasant girl and appliance guy were unable to match the right spacer with the right appliance. \\n \\nTo the manager at best buy,  my time is valuable.  Your inept handling of sales have wasted hours and hours my time, and your staff could really care less.  The only gratification is to know that you lost money on this non-sale and you still have to pay the installer.\\n\\nI learned a good lesson though, why would customers go to your store when we can buy  online easier and more accurately and skip the ugly attitude from your staff?    If (probably when) your store goes broke and then closes you shouldn\\'t be too surprised.Disappointing...we are here at 8:30 pm and they have decided to only serve the Late Night Menu (10pm-Close is what the menu says). We won\\'t come back to try again.Why are there no pre made flower arrangements??? I had to buy 3 packs of flowers and then a vase and attempt to make my own arrangement. No bow. It looks so tacky. Thank you for wasting my time Fry\\'s. I was in a rush and chose to stop here, lesson learned. I will drive the extra 5 blocks to Safeway!I went to Agra for lunch a couple of days ago for their lunch buffet, and I have been suffering from severe food poisoning ever since. The buffet is so extensive that I\\'m not sure how fresh all these items are, not to mention the desserts. I fell sick within hours of my meal, and still have symptoms 48 hours later. \\n\\nThe food was tasty, but considering how sick I have been ever since, this is not a place I would recommend - I will not be visiting Agra ever again myself.I just spoked with Paul Williams who response to my previous reviews because of the poor rating I gave. First, he sounded like he\\'s concern about it and I don\\'t know what he\\'s after for but the conversations ended up ugly. I don\\'t like the word he said \"DONE\" what is that mean? They tell their customers they give lifetime warranty with their jobs and now it sounded like only the paint job is guaranteed life time. This place is a bunch of \"BS\". Very poor customer service.. they don\\'t even deserve a 1 star at all.Timing is everything. And because of the movie I really wanted to see, along with everyone else, it was really busy. Which I don\\'t understand why we had to purchase our tickets at the concession stand while the ticket desk was CLOSED!!!\\n\\nWe waited in line for 30-minutes to purchase tickets because the line was moving very slow as people were also making decisions on purchasing food and waiting for it.  Now of course, we could purchase our tickets online, but when we checked, the show we wanted to see was practically sold out. And just for the heck of it, we wanted to double check with someone;  which didn\\'t changed. We ended up not watching the movie and left.\\n\\nPlain and simple, this comes down to operations management that should know better that on a major movie opening weekend, like Star Wars, you need a fully staffed team to ensure efficiency and comfort of your customers. The reason why? Because there are plenty of options, we\\'re taking our business elsewhere.\\n\\nFirst impressions mean everything and you can tell, this was an absolutely terrible experience for my husband and I. We have plans to never return to this theater.I don\\'t know if this is the correct PODS location, but this comment is about the entire PODS company, not a specific location.\\n\\nThe whole notion of loading all your belongings into a box and then having the box shipped to the city you\\'re moving to is brilliant and simple...unless you\\'re dealing with PODS. These folks have less than no clue about what customer service is. My brother moved to Scottsdale from Minneapolis. He arrived well ahead of his PODS container. However, when the container did arrive no one bothered calling to let him know his unit had arrived. When he called them he was told, \"Oh yeah. The container arrived last week.\" It never occurred to anyone to let my bro know that his container had arrived.\\nNext was the issue of trying to schedule delivery of the unit to his home. Problem is, no one at PODS location has any discernible grasp of how production scheduling works. All they were interested in telling him is that there will be extra fees for overtime because they\\'re so busy. Since when are the internal logistics problems at PODS any concern of the client? Thankfully, my brother is a very persuasive bloke and he takes very little guff from incompetent lackeys. Of course he paid no additional fees, but a more timid individual would likely be held up for extra charges.\\nAnd then there\\'s the challenge of trying to contact PODS. All communication and billing are handled at a centralized call center, and it\\'s a typical call center staffed by individuals who are paid far too little to give a crap about people calling in with questions, problems, and concerns. So, if you want to contact the local location to see if the unit has arrived...no dice! You get to deal with a call center lackey.\\nMy brother did give a positive shout-out to the guys PODS sent out to empty out his home in Minneapolis and load the container. They damaged only two pieces of furniture and they didn\\'t break near as many fragile items as he was expecting they would, so he was pretty pleased with that.\\nBottom line here is that until PODS matures and figures out its logistics issues, timing issues, and customer service issues, you\\'ll do much better with U-Haul or Atlas Van Lines.I think they are going out of business. Cut their hours. Walls are not stocked. Maybe its because of the horrible music they play or the motionless employees that only greet you as you leave.Worst experience. This guy left water marks all over the grill and paint. When I told him if he could take care of it he went to get the windex and sprayed it on the roof and on the paint. SmhMost disgusting biryani I have ever ate in my life, first of all it\\'s not biryani, they mixed some pre cooked rice with pre cooked lamb curry and added some spices over it, what\\'s funny is the name of the place is biryani... ! Either they should change the name of the restaurant and remove biryani from menu and name that as yellow rice and lamb curry. I spent $17 for that yellow rice. I\\'m not coming here for sure, also tell all my friends never to go there. I wish yelp has negative stars I would have given negative 10. I bet you can cook better than what they are serving here. So watch out guysI had an absolutely awful experience here.  I had Stephanie as my stylist who I was told was very experienced, but did my color in no way like I had asked for. When I expressed that to her at first she gave me the excuse that it was the lighting in the room. When I talked to the manager of the salon I was also treated like I either wanted a discount, or I was in some way responsible for the work I was unhappy with. The manager and the owner were completely uncaring that I hadn\\'t received the style I had asked for and proceeded to charge me for it anyways. When I continued to complain that this was not acceptable the manager decided to throw me out saying that they couldn\\'t help me and to go back to where ever I had come from. I have never felt so scammed by a salon ever in my life. I will continue to tell everyone I know not to waste there time or money at Tula salon. Now I have to have my color corrected somewhere else which is really sad considering I just had to pay for such shotty work here. I\\'m a new mom and I don\\'t get to do much of anything nice for myself lately...this was supposed to be a really fun thing for me to get out n try to feel Alittle better after being stuck in the house for months with newborn twins.  It was just such a disappointment it really was an awful experience for me.This is the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant in Pittsburgh.  If I could give this place 0 stars I would. \\n\\nWe stopped in on a Monday evening at around 7:00 because it looked nice having recently been redone. We decided to sit at the bar to hopefully order a few glasses of wine. After about 5 minutes the bar tender decided to acknowledge our presence and asked what we wanted. \\n\\nAfter looking at a not too large list of wines by the glass we told the bar tender what we wanted. He returned with one glass of wine and then forgot what I had ordered. After a while we asked to see a menu and decided to order the stuffed pepper appetizer. We were told they didn\\'t have that.  \\n\\nTo make a long story short, we left with only having our two glasses of wine and no food. \\n\\nMy suggestion is that you can go many places in downtown Pittsburgh and get treated very nicely and get good food... BUT NOT HERE!\\n\\nDon\\'t waste your time or money. They apparently don\\'t want the business.We had visited the original Carolinas a couple of times before and always had great service and delicious food. Today we visited at the Cactus location. Tables were clean and inside looked nice. However, our food arrived cold. Maricopa Dept of Health should definitely stop by his location to test temperature of food that is suppose to be kept at a certain temperature like meat, chicken, fish, eggs, dairy:0!!! The tortillas weren\\'t warmed  and chips tasted old and stale. Manager Vanessa was very unprofessional when we expressed our concerns. This is a one and done for us. We will visit he original location from now on.Worst business that I had to deal with in the last ten years!\\nI brought my van on a Saturday morning for a repair and they said that they can\\'t work on it and I can make an appointment for another day. So I made the appointment for the following Saturday at 10: AM because this is a work van and I can\\'t leave it at the shop on week days. All it needed were oil change and couple of things checked and hopefully repaired. \\nI showed up for my appointment left the van with them and left about my business. I was waiting all day for a call from them but nothing. Around 3:00 PM, I decided to stop by and check what\\'s with the van. I was surprise to find that they already left for the weekend, the van untouched and the keys are locked inside the shop (now I can\\'t work with the van). I was lucky that the owner showed up and let me take my keys. Even after that they never had the courtesy to call back or anything like they don\\'t care. I will never set foot in this place again.I would give them zero stars if that was an option. I submitted a claim on damage done to my car in transit. My bumper is literally taped on at the moment because of the damage they did and they have no sense of urgency in getting back to me as to what\\'s going on with the claim. It\\'s been 4 weeks since I submitted the claim and no one will call me or email me back.  This place is a black hole. The name \"Dependable\" is a joke.  Some of the worst customer experience ever!!Was approached in our neighborhood by a few guys in regards to our windshield. I knew it was cracked but hadn\\'t really put much into replacing the glass. I asked \"Cody\" what the incentives were to go through their company and he said, \"We are doing a free tint strip and a lifetime guarantee  (although this company has changed names)\", my daughter had a birthday party coming up and know that a lot of company\\'s offer some sort of rebate check so when I brought it up, he assured me they could give me a $60 check at the time of service, so I agreed because of the check.  Well the next day they went to my boyfriend\\'s work to replace the windshield and to my surprise my boyfriend didn\\'t mention a check. I text Cody and said we never received the check and that I would go to my insurance company due to their fraudulent activity, so he had a manager call me to assure me that a check was going out in the mail... WELL a week later and there still is no check. I text Cody about my displeasure and shockingly there was no response. This is a terrible company who lures people in with promises they can\\'t keep. I would never recommend them.Slow service and rude, abrasive, disrespectful mangers who called the police because we refused to pay for $100 of food and drinks that we did not order or receive. Very disappointed and shocked!I\\'m always happy to support local businesses and was happy to see something new opening instead of closing on Mill Ave. However, Poppa Maize\\'s popcorn is, well, how do I put this... horrible. We tried the chocolate peanut butter and cake batter last night, and threw out full bags after a couple of bites. Even my kids wouldn\\'t eat it, and they are usually like human vacuum cleaners. The texture was like styrofoam and both flavors were oddly bitter. I don\\'t know if the popcorn was old or if it\\'s always this bad, but I don\\'t want to try it again.\\n\\nHoping they can somehow fix their mistakes... sounds like they have some fans and are capable of much more than what I tasted.Disaster for customer service. I was quoted 15 minutes and waited 40. People working there seemed clueless. Salad was terrible. Pizza very expensive. The one in Chandler is better.  Stay away from this location!!!!It\\'s no wonder this place is now closed.\\nThey were not friendly, and the last couple times I went, they tried to overcharge on the bill, so I never went back.So i decided I wanted to try something new for lunch and was over near La Parilla Suiza figured would give it a shot, bad idea. First of the server completely misleads me intentionally from ordering a $6 apetizer to a $16 meal by asking me if I want mushrooms with all nonchalantly like it was optional ti have with an appetizer, little did I know that now allowed him to charge me for a dinner on their menu how lovely. Then the appetizer was not even what he told me it was or description said it was which was supposed be queso dip instead was just like a huge gob of melted cheese with mushrooms of course obviously unappetizing. Whrn i got the bill and asked him why the $16.99 dinner he told that ai said that was what I wanted I explained that he nonchalantly told me that it came with if I wanted to which he nor the manager cared at all about. So I only gave him a 10% which is very low by my standards. As i am leaving I see him picked it up and call me an ahole. Two points to the story #1 La Parilla Suiza blows don\\'t go there and #2 stick with what you know shoulda went to Valle LunaWay too expensive here, charging 2600 and up for a puppy? No thanks, I\\'ll keep looking elsewhere. \\n\\nSales lady we had was very pushy, kept saying we could finance through them. They have to get commission for selling animals.  She didn\\'t even seem to care what type of environment the puppy would be going to and kept saying that my husky would immediately get along with any puppy.\\n\\nAlso, saw a dog eat it\\'s own poop in one of the glass windows.  Doesn\\'t seem like they take care of their animals here. Some puppies were sleeping on each other and she just grabbed one of them and said look at this puppy!\\n\\nVery disappointed, hopefully this place will learn to price more fairly and will take better care of their animals.This company has the worst customer service possible. They dropped off a helpless elderly lady at my hospital instead of a nearby business. The address was clearly  written down and obviously NOT the hospital. When I called the dispatch to have them send the cab back and take her to the correct place, they refused and then hung up on me. Twice. How on earth is this company still in business.They deserve ZERO STARS but Yelp doesn\\'t offer that option. I\\'ve used this car wash several times out of convenience,  however the service and quality of work is always the same...TERRIBLE!  Even when you call them out on the lack of effort, their none contributing to society, waste of space employees still do a s@#ty. \\n\\nIf I\\'m not clear, I\\'m saying YOU SUCK FULL CIRCLE...We ordered a stone bench from here and we were told that it would arrive on Friday.  We were having a  party on Saturday, so we wanted to make sure that it was going to be there.  We were assured that it would.  It did not come.  When we called they had no record of the purchase and the girl that answered the phone was extremely rude and unprofessional.  After about an hour on the phone, and the girl swearing at me, the error was figured out and they sent the bench that day.  Too much hassle to save a few dollars.  The bench is awesome we love it, we will never return to this place, save yourself the headache.Never again. My daughter and I wanted to get a fun pedi before we left for a trip to Disney. We decided we would get matching Mickey Mouse heads on our big toes. I picked this place because I saw that they had chairs for kids, but my daughter wasn\\'t even offered a seat in them. The spa pedis were decent and competitively priced for the area, but the paint job was absolutely atrocious. I should have known when they asked what design we wanted and I said Mickey Mouse heads and all we got in response were blank stares from the technicians. They really had no idea what we meant. So, I quickly did a search on my smart phone for an idea to show them. When I showed my technician right as she started my pedicure, she said, \"Ah, easy!\" So, I sat back and relaxed and figured all would be great. They asked if we wanted our fingers done, too and I declined because we were short on time. Am I glad I didn\\'t pay for a manicure here! My daughter\\'s nail tech said that she would include a paint job for my daughter at no extra charge since I was getting a longer pedicure. After seeing the awful job that was done on her nails, I am so glad that I only paid for a totally messed up pedi, not a messed up mani, too! The paint on her nails was incredibly sloppy. Her toes did turn out okay (not great,) so they were decent enough to go to Disney with, but my toes turned out HORRIBLY. The tech struggled to make a round circle to start off the head! The bottoms of both of the heads on my big toes was squared off! Plus, she was attempting to center the heads and one was way off to the left. Never mind the fact that the ears are proportionally way too small for the size of the rest of the head. It all looked awful! And then, to top all of that off, when she was painting them she accidentally dragged a line of black across the rest of my big toe and instead of fixing it properly, she just tried to just dab it with nail polish remover and then immediately paint over it. So underneath the \\'mickey\\' head immediately began to chip! WORST PAINT JOB EVER! Finally, when I went to pay I was still going to leave a moderate tip, but when I handed the girl cash she acted shocked at the size of my tip and asked if it was for both techs or just one. I will never be back.I brought my son here on Saturday & from the looks of pictures the burgers are larger than most so we chose to split it, my son is 13 & we could had each eaten our own, our waiter (Daniel) was irritated we only got water with lemon, we ordered the Mac & cheese burger & the fries were the best part full of flavor, the burger, my son could had made that with more flavor! I was disappointed because Guy has such a flare for flavor on his TV show & his restaurant didn\\'t stand to my expectations nor fit the price, & especially the wait time.  We ordered at 2:14 & didn\\'t get the food till 2:53... Once finished eating waiter (Daniel) swung by to see if we would like dessert & I kindly said no thank you. He put the check down hard as our table moved & silverware clanked & walked off to socialize with another table. Glad I had cash! I gave him a few dollars for a tip although it wasn\\'t deserved!the veggies are NOT fresh. They are just as bad as subway. The rice noodles in the soup are not cooked enough. The spicy lemon grass is nothing but water with lemon. If there are expensive topping like avocado,  they \"forget\" it. Then they\\'ll say they will add it for \"free\" next time you order food. If you order rice noodle soup, they will fill most of the soup with cheap Chinese rice-noodles and put very little toppings. This really sucks.Littering my neighborhood with stupid flyers stuffed into front doors is not welcome.  I called and asked for someone come remove the unsolicited flyers.  I was transferred to someone else who said it would be easier to just throw it away.  When I said I\\'d report it as littering as they were blown about the neighborhood, he said \"I\\'d like to see how that goes for you.\"  That\\'s a great way to earn business.\\n\\nThese flyers are unwanted, a total waste and create a more negative brand impressions than positive.Only reason this place is getting 1 star is because I cant give zero or negative stars. The \"food\" is terrible, had a couple bites then threw the rest out. I woulda gave it to my dog but he doesnt desrve that lind if punishment. If you want blan, soggy, and flavorless food that saltier than a Cowboys fan after a playoff loss, this is your place.My husband and I have both been using this car wash and were pretty happy with it. We had recently gone in there and were both disappointed.   I took my car in late in the afternoon and it seemed like the guy who cleaned the inside was in a hurry to get done and go home. My husbands truck was hurried through as well. We won\\'t be going back.Disgusting. We just spent $35 on dinner and I just sent half of it down the garbage shute. The fried rice was easily the worst in recent memory: think fish sauce amplified by 12. The greasy ho fun noodles were a highlight, ironically, while my wife only got halfway through her soup. Never again.Not worth the price at all! You don\\'t charge $35 for a buffet without sashimi! Chicken taste like rock! King crab legs taste like over night socks! You know why they charge you at outside before you come in? You will run away after looking at their food!Pretty much the same as all of the other reviews. Can\\'t ever get someone on the phone with customer service. The speeds are dial up slow. I can hardly make it through a Netflix movie without it buffering several times. It\\'s unfortunate that they have a monopoly on this building. If enough people have had enough of their subpar service, they might just find themselves out of the building.Avoid!!! Avoid!!! Warning!!! This company will waste your time and money. Great product but they will bill you whatever they want and they will claim that you have an extended contract anytime you try to cancel. I had a one year contract for $140. They charged me $180+ every month was different. When my contract was up, they said I had a two year contract. My two years is up now they are saying I extended my contract. No such things have ever happened since I have been trying to get out of my contract. Last month I was promised this was my last month in my contract. Now they are saying I have another year or pay termination fees. They will make up anything to keep you in contract.Pizza is good if you get what you actually ordered. I just ordered a ham, pineapple, and jalapeno pizza, simple, right? Well first they gave me olives instead of jalapeños. I called them and they happily agreed to make a new pizza with jalapenos, so I drove back to get my new pizza. This time it came with jalapeños, but instead of pineapple it had pepperonis. So I basically just drove here twice to get two incorrect pizzas.It so over priced and the kids meals dnt even come with soda and its 5.99 with out the soda, and the sodas are like 2.99 how does that work?? I dont recommend this place at all!!!!!I wish I could give negative stars. This restaurant was by far the worst restaurant I\\'ve ever dined at. The service was awful. Buyer shouldn\\'t not beware after this post. The food was awful. Absolutely awful. 7 people struggled to eat the tapas and entires. 7 people should devour food not sit back and look at it. Robbed us of our money. Regret ever going thereCornbread was like sawdust, burger was ice cold in the middle, calamari gave me food poisoning and Max and cheese was bland. So expensive for such a horrible experience. Never going back here.My wife and son are picking up his car at Ewing Bros right now because he had gotten into a car accident a few days ago.  Apparently the lady there is ripping them off and saying she did not know the car was not drivable so they are charging EXTRA.  Are you really that ignorant lady?  It doesn\\'t take a genius to see that it\\'s completely totalled!  \\nFurthemore, they are absolutely rude.  They remind me of Stoneridge Towing in Hawaii.  They all should be shut down!  Mahalo for allowing me to warn more people about your work ethics.Buyer Beware!  Our experience with this company began in January, 2012 and has continued to deteriorate over time.  Our air conditioner went out because of an electrical panel short.  We referred to the \"To Fix It\" list and identified an electrical company to come out.  They did a great job in fixing our electrical issues but could only recommend another company to handle the air conditioning issue.  It was a weekend and freezing cold and since we were so pleased with the service we received from the electrical company we believed what they said about One Hour AC&H.  They recommended a new unit, said our ducts needed to be completely redone because they were so old and deteriorating, vents need to be installed, that if we purchased this new unit our heating and cooling costs would be reduced by 50%.  That\\'s what he said -- by 50%.  (BTW - our electric bill has not gone down one cent since installing the new unit.)  Over the course of 2 days they completely redid everything -- installation, all new ductwork and vents, a cleaning system.  The works.  Since then half of the our house is still warm; we\\'ve had service people out several times and they don\\'t even know why they\\'ve been told to come to our house.  At one point we discovered that our filtration system had not even been hooked up.  Our son was asked to crawl up into the attic to help them complete the installation.  The vent holes were sloppily cut and some of vents don\\'t cover the damage done to the drywall.  They installed a vent in our garage storage room!!!!!  We paid for the bi-annual servicing of the unit and every time we make an appointment they call and say that they\\'ve got so much to do they can\\'t make it out to our house.  They did that to us 3 times and at that point we told them if they didn\\'t show up the fourth time we wanted our money back for the service plan.  A service guy did show up this past weekend and wanted to know why we had several of our vents closed - we had done that to help with the lack of cooling on the one side of the house.  The service guy said it wasn\\'t good to do that because it put pressure on the fan.  He then went up into the attic and came back down and said that there was a 2 inch gap in the ductwork which he said he fixed and that should help with the temperature.  He also said he would talk to his supervisors about this and that someone would be calling us.  We\\'ve tried talking to these folks many times and they never call back.  We to date have not received a call back as the last service guy promised.  Don\\'t EVER use this company.  We found out later that they work on commission.  They are only interested in selling expensive units and have no intention of following up on their promises.  I\\'m embarrassed to let any of you know how much we paid (are still paying) for this experience. As part of the sales pitch we were also told that our new unit would be eligible for an energy-savings rebate from the electric company.  After we purchased the unit, and after we had to remind them of the rebate offer several weeks later, they submitted the rebate request, which was ultimately denied.My office gets takeout at this place all the time because it is close. When I won\\'t even eat something that is free, you know its gotta be bad. Yuck.\\n\\nEat at Chinatown Inn instead.I had an appointment today and when I showed up she said didn\\'t know what I was talking about. I saw my name in the appointment book but claimed it was another lady who had just shown up. She obviously had double booked. I recognized her voice from when I made the appointment. Will take my business elsewhere and suggest others do the same.Worst Service ever, lost my id last night at vintage and went up to the guy at the front for some help and he said and I quote \"your fucked\"...then I went back at 2:15am as directed and when I went to front door, it was locked and I banged on the door to no avail until finally after 15mins of banging on the door a security guy comes up to the door (doesn\\'t open it mind you) and stares at me and gives me shitty looks and pretends he can\\'t hear me.  This place is full of shitty people and shitty serviceI would leave less stars if I could.  Worst Persian food I\\'ve ever had.  Nothing was fresh, and if I wasn\\'t as so hungry, I would  have left it all and refused to pay.  The four star reviews are totally inaccurate.  Hope I\\'m not sick from this meal.Arrived at 11pm to be told that they oversold the hotel and sent us elsewhere further away. The manager on duty said its there policy to overbook the rooms. It looked unclean and the staff clueless. Avoid at all costs.We waited an hour for our order of the Sushi Regular. Its very pricey for a very small amount of Sushi. 14-16 bucks for 13 pieces of sushi. It is not worth it. The quality of the sushi? It was soft and tender but prepared awfully. It broke apart very easily.\\n\\nThe price wouldn\\'t have been an issue but the waiting amount was crazy. The place was empty and it still took an hour. I trusted Yelp on this one and was highly disappointed.If they ever called me back Id know the level of quality work they do. Unfortunately after 3 voice mails over 2 weeks to both guys I haven\\'t been called back. Ill remove this review after I get a call back, until then, 1 star.Worst fucking place on the planet! Waited 30 minutes for someone to open the door, called nobody inside opened the door! It\\'s a joke!What the heck has happened to this place!!??  There obviously has been a conscious decision to just let this place go. The interior is in need of a renovation, the associates rarely say hi or offer help, many not friendly, many homes where product goes is empty, broken displays everywhere, missing price tags, the counters at check out and return look terrible, the place is dirty, foot traffic is way down, many off brand products, flea market toys and junk for sale up front, etc. This used to be my first location location I\\'d  go for any electronics, now it\\'s the last!!!This is the second time I have come here. The first time, I ordered Avocado toast and they were out of avocados, I asked for sprouts instead but they were out of that too. I got a smoothie that was disgusting. This time I ordered avocado toast and they were out of bread. Don\\'t bother coming here.Still can\\'t stand this place, gave it a few tries. Service sucks! I always get the same guy who messes up my food. I swear on purpose. Then when I say something they treat me like a bad guy. What\\'s wrong with this place. Saw the ad on IG and told my bad experience. They said write an email in detail. I did, they didn\\'t even respond with an apology. Whoever is in charge sucks! Place went from 4.5 stars to 3.5 stars real fast!Called & talked to Lee in commercial about replacing or repairing a rollup door on a commercial bulding. He laughed at me & said by the time he gets a quote done he could already have the work done. I then told him my company requires a couple quotes submitted prior to getting any work done. He then said rudely \"call them, they will screw you good\". I said thanks & hung up. They only want easy sales & not put any efffort in. Ironically, i had a garage door installed at my house a couple years ago by overhead door. They won\\'t be getting my business in the future.Wanted to substitute sausage for bacon in a breakfast burrito. They charged me an extra $1.00 for that. I asked her why. She said she is not allowed to substitute any ingredients - ever.\\n\\nPSA for those of you who don\\'t like their food EXACTLY the way it\\'s printed on the menu.\\n\\nI won\\'t be back. Doesn\\'t matter how good the food is. Restaurants with business practices that don\\'t make sense do not earn a return visit.Well, it arrived, I can give them a star for that... I ordered using Eat24, and I\\'ll give credit that it came earlier than expected. That being said, I\\'m kind of shocked that it wasn\\'t hot, barely warm even.  I also selected the spice factor at very spicy, as high as it could be, and this was so bland a toddler could have eaten it. it bordered on sweet even.  I ordered Gen Tso tofu and garlic tofu, lunch and dinner, if you will.  After one was cold and bland I sampled the other, just in case.  The 2 were virtually interchangeable.  Only difference was the garlic sauce was thin and not as congealed as the Gen tso\\'s.  I paid extra on one dish for lo mein, and the amount was not worth it in comparison the the rice that would have been included.  The veggie spring rolls were mush inside.  Over all I was completely disappointing and will stick with Emperors palace or Ty Fun when I need my fix.Love this place but went and got some chips and queso they forgot the queso and told me I was lying about it and I had chicken in a bowl and the chicken was burnt.The rent is far too high and is raised every year. The apartments are tiny and very outdated. The women who work in the leasing office are very rude, they act like you\\'ve ruined their day if you come to pick up a package. We\\'ve called multiple times to have things repaired; they either never show up, don\\'t know how to fix what\\'s wrong, or blame the issue on the tenant. They have ridiculous lease requirements but never enforce any of the community rules (parking, noise, drug use, etc). I would never live here again, and would never recommend it to anyone I know. Don\\'t waste your time looking here.Dear Zipcar Toronto, \\n\\nThank you for winning my worst lifetime customer experience besides Sears and CapitalOne. They harassed me at least 5 times on a yearly basis to rentals I had, and trying deeply hard to take money from your pocket for fault not made by myself but other Zipsters / strangers. If you eventually find sufficient proof to show them you are innocent and upset, then they gave you a verbal sorry and that is it, easy than anything. And expect harassments and taking more and more money from your credit card account without giving you sufficent proof. You want to fight for it? It took days, your patience, and your mood as well.\\n\\nOverall their nonprofessional practices and sneaky customer experience have outweighed the convenience they provided. To me they are more like a scam or a drug now, it does me more financial harm in long term. I am planning to report them to BBB currently.\\n\\nMy friends, I can write tons of my sad AND  true stories honored by Zipcar but I decided just not to use it in my life(Even their cancellation takes time, haha.). \\n\\nGet over it.\\n\\nPS: Ask me personally if you really want to hear my stories regarding to dents, dings, floods, and even collisions not made by myself.\\n\\nLeon\\nZipcar Member Number: 2296963I\\'m so dissatisfied and disappointed. The sooner I\\'m done with this place the better. If I could give negative stars I would. It\\'s ridiculous. This school is the reason community colleges are looked down on.What a racket. This is everything that is wrong with economies of scale. \\n\\n-You will spend excessive amounts of time on hold.\\n-You may never actually speak to a doctor. Good luck even getting to a PA.\\n-Everyone you do get a hold of on the phone will pass the buck and transfer you to another department.\\n-No one takes any personal responsibility. It is always someone else\\'s job or it\\'s just the way the system works, etc.\\n-After \"urgently\" ordering me to rush in for an MRI and collecting their $$, it was damn near impossible to get service from TOCA. \\n\\nWorking with TOCA has led to nothing but half-baked information and a HUGE hassle.\\n\\nToo big for their own good. You will feel like a commodity and not a patient.Went their so wanting an awesome Pot Pie   walked in door and saw pot pies in the warmer oven  who knows how long their were their   when we got our PP  mine was barley even warm   already disappointed thought crust was blan  and  not very tasty  i had chicken PP    the potatoes were really big chunks  with skin still on  didnt finish  my PP gave rest to husband when he got to bottom of PP didnt seem like bottom crust was done  dont know if it was because it sat their for awhile in warmer oven  or just not done   I was not happy  wont be back  thought  seating area could of been cleaner   Sad I Love Pot Pies   :(It was not good. There were 3 customers and it still took forever to get the food. The ginger tasted metally, the sashimi was cut wrong and felt off, the wasabi had no spice, and the chimichanga roll was a cold fish stick in sushi form. We were reluctant to leave any tip but gave a little something for goodwill.Stopped by yesterday to try out as I have a store near here. Store is new and clean with plenty of help in kitchen. Customer ahead of me made order and girl on cash draw had to go in kitchen for help. Then when my turn she did not know what was even on their menu board, had to go in kitchen again to get clarified. Made my order for some wings , paid for them then she told me it would be 18 minutes. Told her I was not waiting 18 minutes for wings. This brought another trip to kitchen.came back and told me they could do in 8 minutes. Decided wanted my money back instead, which caused another trip to kitchen. Manager came back and refunded me. Went next door  and got my usual wings in 5 minutes. \\n  Do not mind waiting some but have problem with putting people on cash draw that are not trained.I\\'d rather have store bought pizza from a box than eat this crap. My wife and I like to try different pizza shops so we tried Papa Nick\\'s. Over priced and really bland, absolutely no taste. OMG , put some seasoning in your sauce. The crust tastes like card board. Save your money and go anywhere else.I agreed to take an earlier appointment which took a week 1/2 to get. I got rushed out after my daughter got her X-rays because they had other patients come in. Which I could\\'ve gotten everything taken care in one visit. Then I had to schedule a new appointment an additional week out. My daughter likes the way she was treated but their scheduling sucks!!!!Floors are dirty. No choice of soda as they are all flat & no one seems to know what to do to fix the problem. Very disappointed.Went by for lunch had lasagna(cold and small) had to ask for sauce didn\\'t bother with cheese too much of a hassle for person serving  me.  Veal sangwich  (tasteless) no sauce  very dry one piece of veal .\\nVery expensive $18 with a coke won\\'t be going back.   Lamanna\\'s  excellent hot food and you get a lot more for less .I am a contractor and had a shopping list about $50k long, called Curtis and had the pleasure of speaking to Candy, for some reason.  Not only did she make it seem like I was bothering her she made condescending comments.Located here:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/team-ford-lincoln-las-vegas#query:enterprise%20rental%20cars\\n\\n---------------\\n\\nTo see the beginning of this story, go here:   http://www.yelp.com/biz/enterprise-1-800-rent-a-car-las-vegas-14#query:enterprise%20rental%20cars\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter getting transferred from corporate after our 2 1/2 hour morning nightmare, we told our story to this location and they had our reservation on file.\\n\\n\"When do you close?\"\\n\"12:00\"\\n\"That\\'s in 15 minutes...\"\\n\"If you come and the doors are locked, but it\\'s right at 12:00, we\\'ll let you in.\"\\n\\nWait...your company screwed up, so I have to rush over there and drive like a jerk so I can make it there before you need to close up shop?

We\\'ll take our business elsewhere.\\n\\nSimple suggestions to avoid this in the future:  GIVE YOUR CUSTOMERS THE RIGHT LOCATION AND PHONE NUMBER TO START WITH\\n\\nhow hard is that?They odds of winning are bad! You are more likely to get slap with a frog than wining something above 50 cents! My friends and I each spend money and we didn\\'t even got teased!Was in Vegas this weekend with friends for a birthday celebration and we decided Sunday to have lunch at Wolfgang Pucks restaurant at MGM. I\\'d never eaten at a Wolfgang Puck restaurant so I was excited to try it out.  Sad to say I\\'ll probably never eat at a Wolfgang Puck restaurant again.  We all enjoyed our food, but the service was HORRIBLE. \\n\\nIt started with our waiter basically throwing the drink menu on the table. When he came back, the first thing he said was \"do you have any questions?\"  How about your name?  Luckily we were ready to order so he took it and then we waited, and waited, and waited. It took almost an hour from when we sat down till we received our food.  The tables around us all got their food before us, even tables that sat down after us.  One table sat down after us, ordered, ate AND paid before we got our food.  At one point the waiter came by and my friend asked him where our food was and he said it would be right out.  I was getting ready to go find the manager to ask about our food when the manager came to us.  He said our food was being plated as he spoke, but it still took another 5 minutes for it to arrive.  \\n\\nAfter the manager talked to us, our waiter barely came by our table; he wouldn\\'t even make eye contact when he walked by.  He did manage to clear my drink glass, but didn\\'t bother to ask me if I wanted another one.  After the wait we\\'d had, I would have taken a second drink, but I guess he didn\\'t want us to linger.  \\n\\nIt was also disappointing that the manager didn\\'t bother to compensate us for the long wait and crappy service.  We\\'re not sure why the manager came to us, but clearly he knew something was wrong. How about trying to make it right?  If he had, I probably wouldn\\'t be writing this review.Tried this new Denny\\'s for breakfast this morning,we were seated for a few minutes, when a waiter finally came over and took our order we asked for coffee and sat there for fifteen minutes waiting no coffee was ever brought so we got up and left! Ridiculous we then went to Cocos where as soon as we were seated hot coffee was brought.This is a review strictly about what happened as a result of the lack of security at the front desk - this is not about the amenities or the rooms at the hotel.\\n\\nWhen I checked in at The Venetian on Aug 19, their computer system was down and they were taking everyone\\'s credit card numbers by hand, writing them down, having you write your phone number and full name and signing.  I was very nervous about this, so I used my American Express card.\\n\\nI had a great time at the hotel, but when I got home, I was alerted by Amex by multiple fraudulent internet charges.  I contacted one of the merchants and it turns out the customer had used my correct full name, credit card number, and phone number but the wrong billing address.  Interesting that they had the info I wrote down for The Venetian but nothing else.  \\n\\nAmex took care of the fraud immediately, but when I called The Venetian, they didn\\'t care at all.  They said that there was no investigation and that I couldn\\'t prove it was someone from their hotel.  They put me through to the security department who took my information and then never called me back.\\n\\nThis place has HORRIBLE security.  Do NOT stay there unless you want your identity stolen.They wouldn\\'t do a flat white over ice without charging me for a cup of ice to put it on ice myself. Are they really incapable of pouring something over ice?Let me start by saying this place is a complete joke, whether it starts with the \"luxury living\" while housing section 8 guest or just having rude employees. The fake wood floors is a nice touch if you are looking for cheap. One Of the things I love the most is the 37 kids from section 8 screaming their heads off. Everything is old and cheap, one of the employees explained to us that the place was old and that\\'s why it is the way it is... Oh okay I didn\\'t know that was an excuse for having not so hot water, dips in the floors, blinds made of tissue paper, AC\\'s that could barely cool a smart car, water that smells like sulfur, and phone jacks that have been painted over... Like really? Did you have sloth from the goonies build these? \\n\\nHonestly I get creeped out at night to take the trash out... You feel like you are going to get jumped by a velociraptor or just plain see someone going number 2 in the grass? I also love the vomit in the rocks from old town guest, that\\'s a nice touch.Bought a Groupon to get my car alligned. It was frustrating to get an appointment; called multiple times before getting an appointment. I showed up at the appointment to be told they couldn\\'t do it at that time so we ended up waiting for over an hour. By the time the car was done, half of my day off was wasted.\\nIf you value your time, don\\'t bother coming here.Rancho Flooring installed a tile shower in my house. They guaranteed me the shower (on the second floor in my house) would never leak. Over time the mud around the shower drain  cracked (installed by their contracted plumber) and my shower was unusable for over eight months before Rancho Flooring agreed to reimburse me for their mistake.For starters, the shuttle service took over an hour to come pick us up from the airport. It appeared that they only had one small van/bus to use, but tons of extremely overpriced limos (but be prepared to pay $12+per person for a one way trip on the van.) The driver was very rude,impatient, and yelled at passengers. The majority of the hotel staff was extremely rude and unfriendly. Check-in/out was a long ordeal. The room was subpar. The mini-fridge didn\\'t work, and if we wanted to empty it out to use for other stuff (we were there a week), it was going to cost $25, plus $50 for every day it was empty.Be super careful not to even touch something in it as it\\'s electronically monitored and will charge you whether you drank/ate it or not. We spoke to a manager to have it fixed on the first day, they came to fix it an hour before our check out. The maid service was ridiculous (though we were informed they are contracted out). They barely cleaned the rooms, never replaced towels, threw the shampoos/soaps onto the counter and everyday came an hour earlier and would knock even with a do not disturb sign hanging.The first night we requested extra blankets, 2 hrs. later we still had no blankets, called down a second time and after 45 minutes, they brought up a thin, disgusting blanket.A few of the lights were burnt out, and once they were fixed, the room was still very dark. The couch (with hideaway bed) was outdated, ugly, falling apart and extremely uncomfortable. The entire casino and lobby smelled overpowering and horrid. The food (even for Vegas) is really overpriced and mediocre. The spa was just as bad, one lady even scolded us like children and literally yelled at us b/c we were self touring the locker rooms--even though we explained that the spa front desk attendant had told us to do so.  The hotel itself is a pain in the ass to navigate, to get to the guest elevators, you have to either navigate through the casino or through the shopping plaza. On a weekend night, forget it, with Club Tao there, the place is a madhouse and the entrance line takes up the entire foyer. We ate at I love Burgers, the staff was fantastic, but we all got really sick within hours of eating there. The \"resort fee\" doesn\\'t include the fitness center.  For all of its reputation, The Venetian was extraordinarily disappointing. In fact, when it came time to gamble/shop, we went to other hotels. We were not about to give them any more of our money. While there, I ran into at least three other guests who had the same and worse problems as I did. Next trip to Vegas, we\\'ll be staying elsewhere...perhaps the Bellagio, or MGM.Worst Experience Ever! The customer service reps were very unprofessional and I was unable to get contacts, even though I had a prescription already written up. I tried to order contacts online through another company because they were so expensive. The company needed doc\\'s approval, but was declined because I didn\\'t go through the check up process that I wasn\\'t notified about to make sure the contacts suited me. The entire process just to get in for an eye exam before was even more ridiculous.Gym equipment is outdated and broken, the TV\\'s are useless too. A lots of crime activity, one of my friends car got stolen also another car was broken into. The gate is always open so anyone can enter. And night security is a joke.My three kids and I were pretty hungry and we were excited about trying a new place. We ordered a basic pizza, half pepperoni, half Italian sausage.    My girls ordered the \"kids\" spaghetti and meatballs.  The waitress brought bread, which was good.  Then our pizza arrived.  We were so hungry my son and I dove in.  It was the driest pizza I have ever had.  There was virtually no sauce and what sauce there was, was completely bland.  The hand pulled mozzarella was dried to a crisp and the sausage that was finely dusted on  1/2 of the pizza - maybe around 3 Tbsp. total, resembled fine ground bacon bits.  The girls\\' meatballs had some kind of spice that does not belong in meatballs.  I am Italian and have had my share of meatballs.  Maybe they put nutmeg in it?  It was something off.  I didn\\'t say anything, but my son announced that he had eaten frozen pizzas better than this.  We were so hungry and I was just too tired to complain.  When my check came, it seemed high.  It turns out that they charged me for two full toppings, making my little dried out pizza, $16.00.  Even at $13.00, it was way over priced.  I won\\'t go back.  Too bad because I had heard such good things about this place.First off, I made a reservation for ten of us, knowing it was going to be a busy Sunday morning. When we arrived, the young lady didn\\'t even acknowledge us along with another couple that was also waiting. After waiting a few minutes, an older couple arrived and was helped right away, forgetting that we were in front of her first. Very unprofessional. No smile no customer service. If we didn\\'t have so many people with us we would have left and went to another breakfast joint. Once we sat and ordered, we received our food, which some of the meals were burnt and over fried. I\\'ve tried to eat their again just with two of us, and the service again sucked. I will not be giving Rustic Cafe my money again. I will drive further away from home to Ronnie\\'s Cafe for better service.They get one stars because they keep hiring these rude, untrained, unprofessional, employees. I refuse to order from this one again,even though it is literally right by my house. It\\'s cool I will take my money to dominoes where they won\\'t constantly argue with the customer. Or they won\\'t bang on the door like the police and refuse to announce who they are, I mean do they not train their staff on professionalism? Knowing the slogan the customer is always right, and the manager David sounds like a robot and needs more classes! They need to get their lives together, no one wants to deal with this mess at all.First of all, let me say that I love these dresses. I think the flexibility of their design is wonderful and their quality is good. I have not visited their physical location, but have dealt with the company online and via phone.\\n\\nI ordered a test dress that arrived quickly in the mail. I ordered 4 more dresses for the rest of my bridal party at the beginning of May and was told that they were currently on preorder because they didn\\'t have enough in stock. That was fine, I was willing to wait, and when I called at the beginning of June, I was told that they would be ready to ship at the end of the month. When they hadn\\'t arrived by July, I called again and was told that there had been a delay but they would definitely be ready to ship by the end of the month. When I called again at the beginning of August, I was again told that they would be ready to ship at the end of the month. At which point I cancelled my $900 order that included bandeaus and groomsmen accessories since I wasn\\'t confident that they would be able to fill my order in time.\\n\\nTo make a long story short, if they have your color in stock, get it! But if it\\'s out of stock, be prepared to be proactive about contacting them, since, in my experience, they will not communicate anything with you otherwise.One star is more then they deserve.\\nThey didn\\'t show up to the first appointment. I send them an e mail and they say they will be there the next day. Didn\\'t show up to the second appointment! Two no call no shows is amazing, any job will fire you after one. I Send another e mail and they casually tell me someone will be there tomorrow (no apology just a excuse about someone getting held up at another job). So repair guys show up around 545pm the next day and are gone by 6 (still hour and a half of day light) without saying a word. They opened the filter to drain and left it there. So of course I send another e mail, which didn\\'t get a response.I have been left with that for two days so it looks like Im now stuck doing the job myself. A simple task like cleaning a filter or possibly changing the grids, which should take one day, is now into day 9! \\n\\nA little lesson in customer service for these guys. I\\'ll keep it really simple, like Walmart or any other minimum wage customer service first week job training simple. Lesson 1 is reliability, when you say you are going to be there to service a filter BE THERE. If something comes up so you can\\'t be there let the customer know. Lesson 2 empathy, after missing an appointment or making a mistake you should let the customer know that you understand what they are going through and that you wouldn\\'t want to be treated that way either. Lesson 3 ownership or the buck stops here rule, anyone in the company should be able to say \"I can help you out\". In fact saying \"my guy got held up at another job\" is exactly what you shouldn\\'t do, especially if you\\'re the owner like in this case.\\n\\nInstead of going on and on about these people I will look at the bright side. If college doesn\\'t work out, at least I know I can own a pool service.Below average service and average food for the price.   Views are great but there needs to be some staff training on how to serve. Disappointing for sure.So we have been coming to karaoke at a few places for a while on the east side and happen to stumble on fullers bar and grill in mesa. We started going there for about a month or so and on Fri nights there was this karaoke host that decided to say that he doesn\\'t take anymore songs after 1 am unless he gets tips???? Wtf is this?  Our names were in for our second song by 12:30 and we still were never considered and this my friends is wrong!!!!!\\n\\nEven if ur name is in before 1 am u will have to pay for ur place to sing even if u have had ur song in place for over an hour   pay me or else. Wow?   \\n\\n\\nHe literally removed our names from the bookYou will get a car at a cheap rate. But it will be one beat up piece of crap. Staff are rude. Reserved an economy got a minivan that had been put through the ringer- dents, scrapes, missing parts, stains on upholstery, funny smell from the vent. Spend $20 more and go with another company.This review is not based on the quality of the food, more the quality of the service. It is asinine that at peak lunch hours, it takes at a minimum 40 minutes to receive food. There are 2 people on the line, one cashier. This is absolutely insane and no way to run a chipotle. At a chipotle in Philadelphia or New York there would be at a minimum of 6 people on the line. Just because this is madison, Wisconsin does not make an excuse for the absurdly slow service. This has clearly been addressed in other reviews before, so why has management done nothing? It\\'s a shame that this horrible service encourages customers to walk out when seeing a long line rather than waiting. Terrible!I placed a takeout order from Yuva through GrubHub. It said the order would be ready in 30 minutes and so I arrived 20 minutes after I ordered it, expecting to wait a few minutes after I found a parking spot (no easy feat on S. Craig St.). When I got inside and told the lady at the counter that I was picking up a takeout order, she said they still had not received it. As I was calling GrubHub customer service, she \"happened\" to find it as I got through to an agent and rushed it to the kitchen. I asked the agent to look into it and admittedly the order failed to be delivered the first two times, whether due to a failing on GrubHub\\'s part or Yuva\\'s part, I do not know. However, it was confirmed that the order had made it through ten minutes earlier.\\n\\nAt long last, when we had our food and made it home, we tried the food and were utterly disappointed. The samosas were poor compared to others I have had, a tough maneuver to pull off given they are usually frozen samosas anyhow. We also had bhaigan bhartha and kofta curry (known at authentic Indian places as malai kofta), both of which were a major disappointment. I have had malai kofta at many different Indian restaurants and this was the least flavorful I have ever experienced. The bhaigan bhartha, on the other hand, was charred so much that the smoke level nearly exceeded every Scotch in existence. We requested that both be made spicy and neither were. I will certainly never be going back. I highly recommend Taj Mahal on McKnight and Taste of India near the Children\\'s Hospital if you want actually good Indian food.After reading so many positive reviews for Lights Out I thought I would give them a try.  Long story short, I called and left a message.  The following day I received a voicemail from them.  Over the next 3 days I called and left 4 messages asking for a call back.  I am still waiting.  Every business can experience some snags but not returning voicemails is unacceptable.I have gone to streets many times and unfortunately their food is so incredibly inconsistent. When it\\'s good, it\\'s good (however overpriced), but I have never been so disappointed in my life with my last order and this is not the first time things have gone wrong. I spent almost $50 on dinner and did not like one thing. I got a buffalo chicken pizza and asked for no provolone only mottz. They gave me a pizza with only chicken no buffalo sauce or cheese on it. So basically I got bread with chicken. Then I got chicken parmesan . The sauce tasted like it was burnt and stuck to the bottom of the pot. It was disgusting. Worst sauce I have EVER had. Then I got the meatball appetizer which were then again ruined because of the burnt sauce all over it. And To top it off the food was cold by the time it got here so all the cheese was hardened to the containers. I will unfortunately not be a returning customer. My orders have been made wrong too many times.Not impressed at all by the bagels, they have no flavor, and are very doughy.  Lines are very long, fairly disorganized. Not impressed at all. I know the bagels are not supposed to be like Montreal bagels. I was hopping for a great bagel, but these fall way short. I wouldn\\'t be going back anytime soon.Months ago I wrote a raving review about Bluebird Kitchen; however after this morning\\'s 25 minute wait for a toasted bagel and cream cheese I can\\'t say that I\\'d go back there. I stood by and watched order after order come out from the kitchen wondering where my order was. I realized afterwards that the staff at the counter are responsible for simple toasted orders. Those staff members prioritized customers\\' orders that came in after my own, which allowed my wait time to continue to build. Needless to say I wasn\\'t impressed by their customer service whatsoever. Don\\'t bother checking this place out, it\\'s not worth the time.Their tire center is the worst. Just needed one tire replaced, and they had my car for 3 hours. They couldn\\'t ring up my paperwork because the guy put it in wrong and then they needed a CSM to void out the old one. Apparently the woman has called the CSM 4 times but no one has showed up in an hour. A few customers were waiting for battery replacements, but that\\'s another thing they can\\'t do without a CSM, who didn\\'t show up. One customer walked out, and still no CSM. When he does show up, he said he never heard the call, tinkers on the computer for a second, then leaves without doing anything. Several customers are waiting, the front desk woman is incompetent. Don\\'t come here for anything time-sensitive, it won\\'t happen. By far, the worst experience at a Walmart Tire Center I\\'ve ever had. Find a different one.Stay away.  Stay very, very far away.\\n\\nI was desperate for a new pharmacy after getting fed up with the big chains taking forever and over-charging.  So even though I saw the bad reviews of this one, I wanted to give them a shot anyway.  They are just as awful, if not worse, than the previous reviewers said.  \\n\\nI have medication that I have to take due to a serious condition that isn\\'t visible just by looking at me.  It causes severe chronic pain and I\\'ve been on pain meds for over 5 years - but I\\'m young so I generally look healthy.  I dropped off a refill here on a Thursday morning and was told they could fill it for me on Saturday morning.  Ok, fine.  I come back Saturday morning and they say, Oh, we can\\'t fill it for you because your doctor never called us back to verify.  So it\\'s a Saturday morning and I obviously can\\'t get in touch with my doctor and NOW they tell me??  NO ONE from the pharmacy called me since Thursday or I would have gladly called the doctor myself yesterday and had them get in touch.  No one bothered.  So I tried to explain this to the pharmacist, Keith, and he immediately decided I\\'m a pain pill junkie and drug addict - and he basically even said so, comparing me to a heroin addict.  My husband was with me and he was so shocked he was literally speechless.  Extremely rude, extremely poor customer service, not to mention extremely hurtful.  The owners/managers/whoever will be getting a letter from me shortly.  \\n\\nPlease, please spare yourself the rudeness and the trouble and do NOT give this place business it doesn\\'t deserve.  Go to Costco, even go to Target or WalMart, this place does not deserve your money.It was my first time ordering from this panera and I will go out of my way to never order food from here again. \\nFirst of all, I got a half Mediterranean veggie sandwich and I paid to add avocado. There was maybe an eight or an avocado on my sandwich. \\nSecondly, I ordered a cup of autumn squash soup. They gave me a cup of chicken noodle. \\nI\\'m livid because that soup was the primary reason I went to panera, and they gave me chicken noodle. \\nHonestly this franchise has gone downhill. I don\\'t know if I\\'ll ever go to panera again after my recent poor experiences. \\nEveryone: DONT go to this panera if you must go to a panera. I would recommend cafe zuppas, they\\'ve never had a wrong order for me and their food is better.I dont know how this place is open!! No straws, no lasagna, no pizza,no Chardonay and no veal. My eggplant parmesan was bitter and tasted like dirt. Very unwelcoming server. My dinner companion ordered ravioli which was rubbery!  Beware!!I go to Burger King quite often but this location is a poor reflection of the overall franchise. The food here is passable; not horrible since they have the same recipe as all other Burger Kings, but not particularly good either. The service though is seriously a problem.\\n\\nNever have I ever seen staff as unsociable, rude, and unaccommodating as the ones here. It\\'s a dingy restaurant with dim lighting and an old looking interior, so of course I didn\\'t walk in expecting fine dining-level customer service. However, just from a short interaction at the cash register, the staff here (and not just one member but multiple staff members) clearly demonstrated to me how much they hated their lives and didn\\'t give a single shit about their customers.\\n\\nI asked about something, they said they didn\\'t have it; no problem, I understand that things happen. But did they offer alternatives or even a meaningless \"sorry for the inconvenience\"? No. The staff here have a serious attitude problem; they don\\'t just lack proper customer service skills, they lack basic manners. That of course is more than enough to convince me never to come back to this location again. There\\'s a reason why this place was completely empty on a Saturday afternoon.oh where to start -   The staff were abhorrent especially at the restaurant.  One was so busy flirting with 20 year old girls he couldn\\'t be bothered to refill my coffee, and the other was seemingly tweaking on meth which is the only way to explain his bizarre behavior and obsessive face touching.  I had to ask for utensils, coffee, butter, jam, and then when the food actually arrived, my eggs were raw and the food was disgusting.  The jacuzzi in the room is not a jacuzzi but a soaking tub, they plugged the holes.  The Ipod dock is a clock radio that appears to have been made in the 1980\\'s.  There is no channel guide for the TV, the cover was missing from our remote so the batteries kept falling out, and there was no real room service to speak of.  The best I can say is that it was clean and the shower was pretty nice.I hope to bring awareness to our unfortunate experience at Futo Buta to prevent another disabled persons from having to be treated like we were.  We were treated with outright mean spirit and disrespect by our server, Abbey, who did not understand that a disabled guest could not sit on one of the restaurants high tables or on a barstool.\\n\\nWe arrived shortly after opening at 11 am and the hostess graciously sat me and my disabled lunch buddy at one of the tables with chairs and not the tall barstools. The physical limitations of the person I was with inhibit them from being able to sit on a barstool or at a high table.  The server, much to our surprise, started off her introduction by telling us that we would have to move to a tall table if it they got a rush. After pointing out the obvious and explaining to the server that my lunch partner was disabled and could not sit on a barstool (clearly!), the server repeated her introductory statement that we will have to move to another table if they got busy.  \\n\\nIt is not clear why this was such an issue to the server or why she felt we should have to be moved.  We were the first customers of the day.  At this point, there was one additional customer now sitting at the bar. We were not in anyone\\'s way and were not blocking anyone or thing.  We were taking up the same amount of space that any other two people would.  We would be happy to move if it was for a valid reason, but the server did not have one.  We just wanted to have a nice lunch.  \\n\\nWe have never been treated with such disregard and disrespect.  I suggest the restaurant management ensure they have a good plan to accommodate individuals with disabilities, or inform disabled guests of your inability to do so.  If you do have plan, you should make sure your staff is aware of it.  Our sever was clearly were not aware and lacked any kind of sensitivity or understanding to the situation.  What a terrible, awful experience.I came in to taco y taco with my girlfriend and some friends and I was quite disappointed. The environment is pretty cool. But I ordered the fries and the guy who made it was pretty rude. I was standing there wandering what\\'s going on for 5 mins while others were getting served finally the fries came out and I didn\\'t even get to choose ANYTHING. He just put some beef on it and pineapple and all these things I was thinking to myself don\\'t I get to choose? At the end I asked for mild salsa and he said it was extra. I\\'ve never heard of a place charging extra for mild salsa. Anyhow it was a real disappointment I didn\\'t like I what I got and the man who made the food was just rushing and real rudeIf I could cuss on here and not have my review erased by a moderator I would. This place is over priced. The famous bedazzled lollipops are defective and the refills don\\'t fit. Tried to bring it back for my daughter and they wanted a receipt. I just wanted them to exchange it for a local 11 yr old without driving back to summerlin and looking for the receipt. This place has ridiculous prices on everything.I have been frequenting this place for about 10 years now.  It has in my opinion and experience fallen from what I once would have given it a 5 star a few years back but no more.  I thought maybe I had a bad day a few months ago and thought Id go again and give them another try.  I love Korean food, especially Kalbi in the dinner entree so this is what I orders for lunch...at $22 bucks its not cheap.  Kalbi is not a very tender cut to begin with because it is connective tissue but got this for lunch and the first three pieces were nothing but grizzle...which tells me it didnt get heated at a high enough temp or a bad cut of meat.  So I told the server to take it back and I ordered a Bulgogi in its place.  While waiting I knibbled on the little Kimchi dishes and rice.  When the entree was brought I asked if she could refill 2 or 3 of the Kimchi dishes and she said it would an extra cost...about a spoons full of vegetables.  So this kinda set me off and told her I have been coming there for 10 years and all...never charged an additional for replenishing the Kimchi dishes and I asked for the bill...paid the $18 plus dollars for three pieces of grizzle, a table spoons worth of rice and two teaspoons of cabbage...told them Id never be back.  I used to love this place.Are our accounts are LOCKED! because we tried to take money out We have called  and talked to 7 different ppl- been hung up twice. We are deff going back to our old bank. If you need the FUND right away due to an emergency GUESS WHAT! they don\\'t allow it. So much for those who service the country and cant get the service they need.I brought my new 2018 Tacoma that I had bought from another dealer (because that dealer gave me a better deal) a month ago to Right Toyota (because Right was closer to my home), due to a defect in my instrument panel cover.  Right said it was caused by \"external influences,\" which meant they would not cover it under my warranty.  I then went to my original dealer where I bought the truck and after their diagnosis, they determined that it was a manufacture defect and replaced it under the warranty.\\n\\nSo sad that Right (Wrong) Toyota treated me the way they did.  I wonder if it was just because I didn\\'t buy my truck their originally, but, they still have an obligation under the manufacture warranty to fix it.\\n\\nShame on them.  Either they are incompetent or lazy.  Either way, they were Wrong Toyota.I did not even try the food, why? Because the way the people that work there talk to me told me they did not wanted to work there. Rude and just for the money people. Then I came to yelp to see their reviews, I knew these were going to be low, and they were low. I can tell you, it is difficult to ruin a simple burrito, but if you have the wrong people on it, they will ruin anything! To the owner: \"take care of your place!\"$12 is a lot of money for a carwash that doesn\\'t work. I came home,  towel dried the car and found that is was still very dirty.  The towel was filthy. All the way around the lower half was dirty.  I will not go back and would not recommend to anyone.8/4 at 4:30pm\\nJust went in there to get a bottle of liquor that i cannot get back in Maryland. I was excited to find black haus there and was even willing to spend the $30 to get it and take it back to Maryland. Well i am waiting in line to checkout when i couple comes in and ask about prices for a particular item. Well they decide and get in line next to me, which I thought was a little odd. So now it is mt turn to check out and the lady at the register who had made eye contact with me dismissed me and checked out the couple that came back in the store at least 5 minutes after me! I very kindly walked out of the store and decided i would never come back and i would tell all of my friends and family  since i grew up in this city and always make it a habit to come here for some food and alcohol. I see my business must not have been good enough for you because you THOUGHT that I don\\'t speak Spanish and or look Mexican like the other people there at that time. It is sad to see my hometown turning into such a sad depressed place that feels so segregated! \\n\\nIf you are not a regular and or not Mexican looking I would suggest you avoid this place. And for the record yo hablo español y podría comprenderte! I live in a very diverse city and have worked with many people from Central and South America since I am a nurse at one of the biggest hospitals in Maryland!Toby Keith I Love This Bar & Grill... Ha!  Ridiculous!!! We walked two miles down the strip to get here. We expected country music (perhaps our mistake?? Toby meets Vegas... No thanks!!!) but we got pop music and a bartender that spent more time throwing the bottles around (attempting to look cool) then actually pouring and serving drinks. We\\'re from San Diego and we have some great (country) bars there... This was so far from what we expected. Booooo!I came here to try it out cuz people said its one of the best buffet on the strip, but I don\\'t think so.\\nPaying $80 for the good that doesn\\'t even taste that good it\\'s not really worth it. I rather go to fine-dining restaurant. I guess Buffett is just never goodWorst place ever. Very rude over the phone when trying to get directions. I called before I came and ask about blood work test and the girl said I had to come in for the doctor to examine what test I need. I get here and THEY DONT EVEN DO BLOOD WORK SO THE GIRL AT THE FRONT DESK CLEARLY KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT THE OFFICE. Thanks for making me drive across town and getting horrible serviceI waited for four hours in the blistering cold and asked for crushed red pepper and you still said no... the pizza is pretty shitty man they had no pepperoni pizza he likes it more than I do... I ain\\'t that mad but I just don\\'t like getting diabetes. The customer service was good nothing bad to say .. but the pizza tasted like frozen diabetes with sesame seeds.Worst pedicure I have ever had. She basically washed my feet and applied nail polish. She didn\\'t even clean up her mistakes. Will never go again.My insurance lapsed, due to income issues. I then called up Jun 24th to find out how much it would cost to reinstate, and was told a rather small amount.  I confirmed with Angie that it was all I needed to pay to reinstate my insurance. So we made the payment over the phone. I then said, so my insurance is now reinstated right? And she confirmed that it was indeed reinstated. \\n\\nI received a call today from the main agent, and she ADMITTED that Angie was wrong, I wasn\\'t covered (they had given me \\'courtesy\\' coverage, which I wasn\\'t advised about during that call) and that they COULDN\\'T cover my home anymore. AND they refused to refund the money paid under false pretenses!!\\n\\nThis has already been disputed with the bank, and charges are going to be filed with the states attorney, the BBB and the state insurance agency!! \\n\\nI can\\'t even comprehend the level of horrible customer service AND then refusing to refund the money charged UNDER FALSE PRETENSES!!\\n\\nBE WARNED...DO NOT DEAL WITH THIS AGENCY!!!I was there for a birthday celebration, which celebrated three people, last Sunday,  March 13, 2016. After waiting for an hour and never receiving any service, I decided to leave. I was later told by my friend that there was only one Server on duty for over 50 people. I understand watching your bottom line, but this was ridiculous. My first and last time at this establishment!Not anymore.\\n\\n20 minutes to check out, as only the self-checkouts were open and available.  5 people cruising around in front of the closed \"person-operated\" registers but no manned register opened for over 15 minutes.   25 people waiting in line behind 6 who were at the self-checkout?\\n\\nWTF?  \\n\\nIt\\'s Sunday evening, too many people in line and whomever is in charge does not have someone open a register?\\n\\nBy the time I got to the self-checkout, the ice cream I came to get was pretty much a waste.  I paid for milk, OJ and broccoli, but left the ice cream.\\n\\nWhile you are the closest to home, you are CERTAINLY not the best.  You have lost my business.Saw all the great Yelp reviews and scheduled a deep clean on 6/26 through their website, since North Royalton was listed as a city they covered.  On 7/1, I received a notice of cancellation with an email from Melissa, the owner, that she did not have a cleaning team servicing that area.  Okay, I was disappointed, but asked politely if she would then reimburse me for the $10 for $20 voucher I purchased through Yelp to use for her service.  Radio silence.  I followed up a week later on 7/8, and still nothing.  I finally got sick of being ignored and contacted Yelp directly, who was able to credit the $10 I spent (for a service that I would obviously not be able to use) on the same day I requested it.  She may do a good job--I have no idea--but bottom line, for me: unresponsive, unprofessional, and I consider that bullet dodged.  \\n\\n(The irony is that in her recent negative Yelp review of a car service, she complains of not getting any responses for something they should be reimbursing her for.  Um, pot, kettle?!)I tried to shop here today to buy multiple shoes for work. This Hispanic girl (using her phone while on duty then sticking it behind her ass as she approached me) asked if I needed help. I asked her if there were any specials and told me they were having a sale. I told her I have several emails with coupons and she said just as long they have a barcode, I can use. I also mentioned I had a  25% coupon my coworker had gave me. She immediately told me I cannot use a \"print-screen\" coupon as if I was a con artist. Then she walked away and did not bother helping me. My coworker told me her Payless location let her use the coupon regardless if it was a print screen. So I was furious and decided not to purchase anymore. Instead I just tried on shoes and took pictures of the model numbers when I knew I liked them. I left the store, went home, and shopped online using the 25% coupon she said I couldn\\'t use and free shipping. Too bad their store would\\'ve made over $100 extra revenue off of me but they chose to treat loyal customers with bad customer service. From now on, I\\'m just going to purchase my shoes online. Thanks lazy girl with an attitude!I would have given this restaurant zero stars if the app allowed it. This is a disgusting restaurant. You can find roaches lurching around the food. The \\'clean\\' dishes next to buffet items are mostly dirty. Just look at the bottom of the plate. This restaurant should really be inspected by authorities.I am incredibly frustrated. Apparently a company called Fitness 10 bought the company and I was never notified. All phone numbers have been disconnected and I\\'ve been trying to cancel my membership. I finally got a hold of a guy named Daniel, the GM of the Blue Diamond location. I asked him to refund my last payment as I wasn\\'t able to get through to them, he told me to dispute it with my bank... Um, no. Why should I have to jump through more hoops to get my money back? He said it wasn\\'t them that billed me but also said that they bought the business in January. I was billed on 2/23/17, which was clearly after they took ownership so why should I have to call my bank and go through that process? Why can\\'t I just get a reversal of the charge??? Bad business practices and a messy transition.Went to this store today looking for a window.  Sign says NO RETURNS !!  Measure 3 times !\\nEverything  here is sold as is.\\nFound a window that had $230.00 written on it after freezing our #$#%$ off for an hour looking.  Rolled it up the window to pay for it and discovered that all their windows are on consignment and a 12% adder would have to be applied.  Then tax as well.  I understand the tax but no where did I see the consignment adder warning posted.  After they did the math our cost with adder and tax went up to $280.00.  I walked.  I can get the same window elsewhere for less money and a warranty at least (I checked).This probably the smallest and most uncomfortable airlines I have ever flown with. The prices are dirt cheap but you get what you pay for. They are usually delayed. When they\\'re not delayed they leave the port five minutes prior to take off time. They do not care about customer service but rather the money. If you can pay for another airline than do so but if you\\'re looking for a quick getaway with minimal cost book away.Not sure if I needed a new cell phone battery as it had been draining really fast. So figured who better to go to then BATTERIES PLUS. Walked in and began to take the battery out and asked if he could test it. What a battery store that won\\'t test to even see if the battery is bad, wtf?  I then asked if he could sell me one and he said sure. Ten minutes later he said he doesn\\'t have one but I could go to one of the other madison stores to get it.  Or I could come back in a few days to pick it up.  He had to count on his fingers to figure out how many days, really?  I asked if they could send it to me, guess what?  NOPE.Terrible customer service signs that don\\'t make any sense at all discounts that are in a plied that you have to get back in line to straight now just a messBLEH! Expensive, over-cooked, not great ethnic variety. Yuck. Pick a different Vegas buffet - Try Aria or Rio. You\\'ll be glad you did.We have been regulars at this place and we used to love it. But today, it has nothing been but the worst service we have had in all of dining out. So bad that I had to review as soon as I got out. Our waitress didn\\'t greet us properly, did not ask if we needed any drinks, and didn\\'t clear our plates. The host did that all. Despite the horrible service from her, I still proceeded to give her a tip as she stood with the machine. She didn\\'t say thank you, and was so rude. There was another table next to us and she said thank you and have a great day to the other table- NOT US. She left without a word and grabbed the cash tip we gave her as if she was ungrateful that we were there. Whoever that server is today- we did not get her name, I hope she realizes how horrible she was today, and the fact that we are Asians and the people next to us were Canadians and got the service everyone deserved just shows how this can be a little if not wholly racist. I am so appalled by this service. I can\\'t believe it.The resto has no patrons at 6pm on Sat. There\\'s no Bud light when they advertise it mainly up front. The staff is not Japanese, has poor communication skills. Told them not to put mayo and still served the dish with it. They were friendly though, with clean surroundings but with generic decor consistent with other Korean owned sushi restaurant in Los Angeles. I don\\'t get it that they open a sushi bar not knowing how unagi sauce should taste like; they watered it down and added thickener. Their \"deals\" on their happy hour are all rolls with nougat-y rice loaded with MAYO(?). They have 4 big TV screens in silent mode. No music and all you can hear are the staff speaking loudly at each other in their native tongue. They didn\\'t welcome any feedback so they will never have a shot on getting better.DO NOT COME TO THIS PLACE. Not worth it.Tech was late for the very first visit.  I had to personally call them to inquire after my 4hr window time had already passed.  They informed me the tech was running behind.  I let it go, even though I was not happy they couldn\\'t call me to inform me.  Bad customer service.  After seeing the tech for a diagnosis of my unit, I scheduled a second appt to repair what was suggested.  On my second appt, I was scheduled between 12-4.  I fell asleep on my couch waiting for a phone call or knock on my door, which I did not receive either.  It was 5:30 when I woke up and I hadn\\'t heard anything from them.  So, I personally called again, like I did my first visit, and the girl couldn\\'t really explain what happened only that she would reschedule me.  I denied and hung up.  I received a call from Susan, supposedly a manager, I missed her initial call and called back.  She has yet to call me back.  Horrible experience!  I had a referral lined up, too, I let them know right away my horrible experience.  I found another company.I went here earlier this month to get my dress steamed for a wedding and the lack of customer service at this place is beyond me. My mom and I dropped off my dress at 3:30pm and the woman working there said to come back in an hour, so my mom and I went to the food court and walked around to kill time. We went back at 4:30 and a different woman was there, she handed me someone else\\'s dry cleaning without even reading the name on the receipt! So I gave it back to her and behind the glass of their working station, I saw my dress on a table and it still hadn\\'t been steamed! It was unbelievable. I couldn\\'t believe that they had told us to come back in an hour yet they couldn\\'t even steam a dress that would\\'ve taken less than 10 minutes if done well! So once my mom had noticed she said something right away. The ladies in the back grabbed my dress and rushed to steam it quickly right before my eyes. She was doing a rushed job, and handed me my dress back with wrinkles and she blamed the material of my dress. My mom got very upset and made them steam it again and the woman there did it and rolled her eyes. You had one whole hour to get the job done! Don\\'t be mad at us for making you do it again because you didn\\'t get things done! I wouldn\\'t recommend this place to anyone, even if this happens to be convenient at the time. Go to another place!Stay away from this place... the food is terrible. I am from India, can\\'t call this any close to Indian food let alone tasty. We were visiting Scottsdale and craved Indian food and ordered carry out from this restaurant. We ordered Chicken tikka masala, dal makhani, malai kofta, naan and gulab jamun (dessert) Food was BLAND, Indian food is known for its spices, this food had NO spice no flavor. It felt like everything was cooked in heavy cream with no spice and no salt. The gulab jamun was spoilt... if we didn\\'t carry out, I would have returned my entire order. Not to mention, it\\'s very expensive. Only positive is the person who answered the phone and got our order ready was very friendly.This place is not the buizness. I got tacos which I can\\'t believe were $7. Whathehell we live in AZ tacos are like cactus here......everywhere!!!!!!! So as I\\'m sitting there surrounded by hella white ppl I\\'m thinking why am I here. My niece didn\\'t even like her chicken tacos, how does a kid not like tacos. That was a wrap for me but my friend keeps telling me it\\'s not the tacos it\\'s the enchiladas. I don\\'t know if I can do it again. Buena suerte?Today I tried the Baby Back Rib Thickburger.  I was disappointed.  The burger was not freshly cooked.  It was really dry.  Also the images in the ads are no where near accurate.  In the ads the ribs look like it is an inch thick and cover the burger.  Instead you get two small pieces of meat about 1/4\" thick.  Look at this picture.  For $6.99 I expected more.  I\\'m also not impressed by the drink choices.  I\\'d like to see more variety.Waited in drive thru for 10 min. When I got to window my chicken still needed to cook so they asked me to pull around.  I smiled and said ok. I waited for 5-6 more min before the guy came out with my food. He said oh sorry, we ran out of beef. I didnt order any beef. .. I had two kids in the car one being 3 months old crying. And my chicken wasnt even hot! I am pretty sure that they forgot about me.Don\\'t waste your money. I got a 50 minute bamboo massage (which was supposed to be like a hot stone massage but with heated bamboo) and it cost $170 because they helped themselves to tacking on 20% gratuity to the already overpriced $140 massage.\\n\\nSecondly, I would not have minded a male masseuse, but when scheduling the massage the woman at the front desk asked if I preferred a female or a male and I said female. Wouldn\\'t you know - what did I see coming out to greet me for my massage? A duuuuddde. Why ask if you\\'re not even going to get it right? What if I was someone who was serious about preference? Very incompetent.\\n\\nAnd lastly, their facilities were not even working that day- so if anyone wanted to use their steam room that was just too bad. Spend your money somewhere worth while- their relaxation room, service, and amenities are not even close to worth the money.This is seriously the WORST chipotle I have ever been to and I have been coming here for years. \\n\\nThere must be new management or the staff that was working on my most recent visit were just plain stingy. One of my favorite parts about ordering at Chipotle is that -duh- adding extra items onto your plate IS FREE (except for meat and guac.) So PLEASE do explain how it is that you think it is okay not to provide guests with extra ingredients when this is a standard courtesy throughout the other locations. \\n\\nSay hello to the SMALLEST and stingiest plate of food I have ever ordered. I am honestly so shocked that they had the audacity to try and charge people for that. \\n\\nWhile this location is nestled with Panda Express and McDonald\\'s between Harrah\\'s and the Venetian, you\\'d do much better to walk a couple blocks down to another location because this place is T R A S H.Drug addict thieves parking your car, they will steel anything they can get there hands on and ameripark will do nothing to seek justice for you... They stand by the thieves they have working for them and not the people paying them to park there car.I\\'m hoping Marcia sees this-- she has my bridesmaid dress and she knows I\\'m supposed to leave tomorrow for the wedding. It\\'s been 11 days for just a hem... I\\'ve left messages with no response. I\\'m sure she does great work but PLEASE CALL ME! I need my dress, my friend is going to kill me! I\\'ll update my review when I get my dress back. :/I have been trying to cancel my membership for over a month and conveniently every time I go into the gym I am told the manager is not there and they have no idea when or if he will be in again. Am I to believe the manager does not have a schedule? I have been 3 times and each time the employees are quite rude and tell me that only the manager can hand out the waiver to cancel. The kid working today told me \"it depends on if the manager feels like processing the cancellation in the first place and if he does do it it usually takes a while because he doesn\\'t like to\" Really? He refused to give me his name, said he did not have to, and said there was no other way to cancel, there is no number to call and no way to contact corporate. I call BS. I can\\'t believe you are able to continue to conduct business this way. I will find a way to cancel, and I will be sure to tell everyone who will listen to stay far away from Blast Fitness.Placed a delivery order for a few of us ($50 min) was excited to read reviews of the homemade chips !!!!\\nAfter order was over 25 min late I got call from driver can\\'t find my house (I get delivery s ever day) I\\'ve never heard this before) order is delivered over 35 min late, the food and homemade chips are all soggy, I normally don\\'t ask for anything in compensation, but this was a $60 order and this is Terrible  service with Terrible food quality, \\nNeil the manager gave a 20% discount but I will contest the 80%, and never use again beware, \\nI would think the food quality would be good if you ate there, not delivery. I will never know, won\\'t go backn\\n\\nWow now customer being attacked for terrible food and poor delivery but thanks for the help were I can improve I have six one star reviews not 31 and I don\\'t do social media, that\\'s why I don\\'t befriend on this site, so know u not only insult your customer but lie on them wow, lets see how long this place stays open, or has this many stars it\\'s just a matter of timeCame for dinner. Waited 45 mins for the waitress (Tessa) to take our order while she was chatting with 2 bar customers.  Bad management decision to have a waitress run between the bar and tables so not totally her fault but bad for a customer experience regardless. We decided to leave instead of ordering.  Place was mostly empty on a Saturday night so that should have been a clue.The last few times we have enjoyed  coming to Texas roadhouse but tonight I am sad to say the service we are receiving as I write this is substandard. First order a beer and asked for with a cold mug and orange. Received bottle of beer only until 5 min later when the server Kristen came and asked if we wanted to order yet. We put in for the sampler appetizer with no ranch only  blue cheese. It came out with only ranch and as we looked at it 2 of the the rattlesnake bites had been overcooked and all the filling came out. So we waited and waited and waited 15 minutes before Kristen came back to check on us and we told her about the issues with the snakebites she said Oh well, but she did endup bringing us our bluecheese. So now we are waiting for our main dishes with hopes of better service. As for right now Texas Roadhouse service or I should say server is truly lacking. We will ore than likely be back because 2 little boys love the small steaks they get but I am very disappointed thus far and we are not even to the main course.This guy should be given a zero. He charges for a retainer and is all ears until he receives that check. Then, you will be relegated to a paralegal and simply be pushed to the side. If you truly want to have a lawyer that actually cares about your case, use someone else.I used to really enjoy shopping at this location.  The lighting was good, the store was clean and well organized.  Now - disgusting!  The floor was dirty, the change rooms were dirty, the employees were unkempt.  I intended to buy three sweaters - two of them I did not buy because there were large holes in the material.  It was like shopping in a bad thrift shop.Fox Sports Grill a year ago would have gotten 4-5 stars.    The service was terrific, the food was above-par for a typical bar, the prices were fairly reasonable although a tad bit upscale and there was a vast amount of seating that would allow you to watch virtually any game in comfort.\\n\\nNow other than the seating, pretty much everything else has changed.   The last two times I\\'ve been here the service was lousy, downright apathetic, there seemed to be no shortage of servers and wait-staff in the place but they seemingly vanished at times without a trace.    \\n\\n\\nNow the worst part.     The menu was overhauled almost entirely.  Previously it was filled with good stuff, at reasonable prices.    What they\\'ve managed to do at Fox Sports Grill in terms of an amazingly epic  transformation is to completely destroy the menu, drop the quality of the food tremendously and yet somehow RAISE the prices.\\n\\nNow you\\'re stuck with overpriced, dry and unappetizing sliders, food that tastes of dirty oil and more.       Their pizzas in the past were fantastic, the crap they\\'re serving up nowadays reminds me more of generic frozen-food aisle grocery store pizza(not even Digiorno).     So the food tastes awful, but they\\'ve had the audacity to raises the prices.\\n\\nNow you\\'re sitting there, paying way above-par prices for sub-par food.   WTF man?      This place used to be fantastic but evidently some genius decided that they could make more profit by offering crappier quality at higher prices.      I\\'m not buying it.      There\\'s too much competition, too many other options for this sort of nonsense.         \\n\\n  I can head to Zipps down the road, The Arena(yeah, its standard bar food but it won\\'t cost an arm and leg) or best of all, Casey Jones Grill where I can pay less and somehow get much better food and service.\\n\\n\\nBottomline, this place has jumped the shark completely.    Whatever they had going right for them is pretty much gone.     Its a shame, because this used to be a fave of mine but after what I\\'ve witnessed there, its not worth spending money or time at anymore.Just got off the phone with this company.\\n\\nFor starters, the person who answered the phone did not even say who he was or if who I was calling was indeed the repair shop. Very rude.\\n\\nI had an issue with couple of my devices. Wanted to fix a few phones and an iPad.\\n\\nWould not give me a price. Kept telling me that he did not know the price. Sounded very shady. \\n\\nI will not come here for any repairs and neither should you.Ikea Sucks!!!\\nI already bought about 10 ENJE Roller Blind and I needed 10 more. After talking to employees I was told that They will restock that item every week and I went to Ikea two more time. Finally , I was told this item will not be available in their store till October and most likely I have to order it on line and the only store in whole United State will accept order on line or on the phone is the one is located in Houston, TX.\\nI did call them and after being 20 minutes on the phone they told me you have to order on line. So I go online and try to order and I receive the email that they will get back to me after 10 days. After 10 days they say that they can not send my order because of their policy. \\nLong story short, I called them today on Tuesday and talked to store manager name Glen in the Atlanta Store and Told him that I will drive over 250 miles to pick what I need and explained him all the story. He acts like it is not a big deal and told me that he is not able to put those item on hold for me. \\nI wish from the first I did not shop with this stupid Swedish company with their F***ed up stupid rules. \\nI will not recommend this store to anyone.Wasn\\'t worth the 25 dollar price tag, food was dry , tasteless, salty, over all I was not happy with quality at all.  I wouldn\\'t recommended it at all. Very disappointing.Uhh, well as you can see in the photo, the sundae they gave me was hollow. 6$ for a hollow sundae. You have to be really cheap to do these kinds of tricks on customers. Safe to say I\\'ll never be back.Food is good but service from the hostesses sucked! She seated all the 2s and 4s before us because we were 3 people. She said she didn\\'t want to waste an empty spot. So we got to wait over an hour and she seated all other guests before us, even people just walking up. Ignorance at it\\'s worst. And no apology or anything. If I was the owner, I\\'d be ashamed.By far the worst salon I have ever been to. I went here asked for balyage and later I got orange hair with spots. paid a ton of money and decided to wait till my next apt with another stylist to get it fixed. She said she would fix it and during the process used the wrong toner and it turned my hair one color. She then had to ask another stylist how to fix it after she apologized and they decided to strip it out!!! I was so upset because it is not good for your hair.\\nThen she had to use another toner and 4 hours later my hair was the exact same as I came in. I talked to the salon manager and she was very rude and said I still had to pay for everything. This place is outrageous and they don\\'t care about your hair at all they just try to get a ton of people in and charge you outrageous prices. I went home crying and called back to see if I can come in another day to get it fixed and they told me I had pay for the products to get it fixed after I paid so much in the first place. Please if you want to save your hair and bank account do not go here! Find a place that listens, doesn\\'t schedule a ton of people at the same time and charge you double. GO TO A SALON THAT WONT CHARGE YOU FOR THEIR SCREW UPS!I went to newport motors yesterday to buy a new car.  I bought 2 cars from them previously. They have a new staff now. The new manager there was awful no people skills what so ever.  He didn\\'t speak when we 1st came in he just sent a new guy out to us who didn\\'t know what he was doing. He had to go back and forth to the manager the whole time. Long story short. The manager didn\\'t want to work with my daughter and I. He never came out of his corner. The old staff was great. No matter if they could help you or not they treated everyone with the best customer service. If you want to get a car from newport motors go to the new one on west Sahara. Avoid ( East Sahara ) like the plaque! !!!J.K. sushi?? Yeah because they are clearly a joke! How is this place still in business?!\\n\\nCalifornia roll, shrimp tempura roll and egg rolls set me back $16 bucks! Worst sushi ever!! Old rice, stale, poorly assembled, not fresh and ugh, just so gross. I\\'ll be amazed if I don\\'t end up sick. \\n\\nOmg, no... Just no.I went there last week. I spent 13.99 on the sashmi combo. Although the service is nice, but they purposely cut the Sashimi way too thin. It was not very joyful experience.Bad sake, very bad raw sea food, extremely bad rice in the sushi, will never let my friends step into this restaurant. I feel curious how can this restaurant get four stars, the sushi bar in my neighborhood is much better than this and only cost 25 dollars each.This isn\\'t the place to take your vehicle.\\nThey were suppose to front end alignment, front brakes. And change my oil with supplied oil.\\nGot a call from Russell that all my rotors and pads needed to be redone. 1100.00, told them to go ahead, the oil was changed, with some new bolt put in as a drain plug (it is now leaking) they didn\\'t put the spacer back on the right rear wheel\\nWhen they did the brake job. The had billed the alignment, after I got there and asked about it,\\nThey removed it from the invoice cause they never did it, I\\'m not done. The day after they did brakes I went to California. The from end was rattling a little more so when I stopped for\\nGas I reached in and the top shock bolts were loose(I had asked them to check the front shocks, and was told they checked them  and they weren\\'t leaking and they were fine. I own a construction company and was looking for a \"honest\" place to bring my work truck to as well as our personal vehicles to. This is NOT the place to bring any vehicle to. I have never written a bad review before this one, but what happened here isn\\'t fair or the right way to do business.Firts time trying out this place and it was a disspoitmend. Even a 3 year old was disspoitmend with the pepperonis on the pizza they where burn and it gave the pizza a horrible tast. Never aging going back!We have been long time customers of Dave at AZ Landscaping.  Although he is ALWAYS late to arrive, does not return calls in a timely manner and has even been a NO SHOW, we have stuck with him because his crew does good work.  We have finally given up!!!  We scheduled Dave two weeks in advance to clean up our yard before a big party.  He was to arrive at 9:30 and by 11:00 he still was not there - typical.  We called him three times - no answer and no return call.  He was a no show AGAIN.  We ended up doing as much of the cleanup as we could ourselves.  Our party went ahead as planned in a yard with dead plants that had not survived the winter.   We never heard from Dave, however his wife called a few days later and apologized that he had failed to put us on the schedule and would like to reschedule to do the work two weeks from now.  No way, they have lost a customer!!!  By the way, Dave does not do any of the work himself, he talks on the phone and runs errands while his very fine crew does the labor.  I recommend that you look elsewhere.I\\'m so disappointed with Brake Masters. Makes me think of all the times I trusted them with my car how much stuff I paid for that I didn\\'t really need and may have not even been replaced. I arrived on Wednesday to have my front brakes replaced since my warranty is through their company. The guy comes out with a 450$ list of items, and also told me that I had not had my brakes done in over a year. Which is a lie as I have all my reciepts. He then tells me i need left caliber replaced, rotors replaced, clean and adjust on back, and brake system flush. Red flag if my brakes haven\\'t been changed in a year why would I only need a clean and adjustment on the back? Mmmmhhhhh when i told him to put it back together he offered to take 50$ off. Now it\\'s Friday i took my car to Honda for inspection. An hour later I\\'m taken inside shop for them to show me concerns with my car...caliber needed to be greased not replaced nothing wrong with rotors shiny and clean as if they had been taken out of box....brakes needed to be replaced..duuhi knew that thats why i took it in to ger warranty honoredas i have been doing for past 3yrs or so. I will never patronize another brake master as long as i live..you have suckered me out of more than enough money.Honda replaced brakes and replaced valve cover all for 175$. Such a weaked world we live in with so many dishonest people.. Shame on you brake masters...NEVER book a booth here!!\\n\\nI came here for a friend\\'s birthday. We booked a booth for this occasion. While I enjoyed their company the whole booth experience was absolutely unsatisfactory.\\n\\nThe booth was uncomfortable and too tiny for us. Menu had a $50 mix and match 3-course meal and you have to order the whole thing. Food quality was mediocre at best (see attached pics) and surely not worth the money. Steak was dry and tasted like it was microwaved. Chicken wings tasted like KFC but without the herbs and spices. To make matters worse they made us pay cover charge for 2 people who did not show up even though the booth was barely fitting us and if those 2 people showed up they would have had no place to sit!\\n\\nI absolutely do not recommend that you book a booth at this lounge. Just drink and dance.Wow compared to the animal shelter in Phoenix this one is a dump.  Poor dogs had lots of poop and pee in every cage.  Smells so bad it\\'s difficult to even walk around.  How sad.  Shame on this place!!Went for breakfast! Food was horrible! Service was equally as bad! If you want dry mashed potatoes this is your place! I asked for some gravy or something to make the potatoes edible and the waitress looked at me like I was an idiot and then charged me $4 for gravy! Not to mention the guy that grabs you and takes your picture at the door and then interrupts your meal to try and sell you a copy for $20!I was excited to have a ramen place closer to home.  I looked up the menu before going and when I got there some of things they didn\\'t have. The portions were small and there wasn\\'t much variety in broth or topping choices.  The fried chicken appetizer was the only decent there. Maybe I am used to other ramen places but even the broth wasn\\'t very tasty.Horrible service! We waited 40 minutes for a table, 20 minutes for service, 30 minutes for an iced tea and another hour for food. Then I had to ask twice for an iced tea refiill. I will not be returning and wouldn\\'t have put my name on this restaurant if I was a celebrity chef.\\nI almost forgot to review the food. The chicken wings were over cooked and the quad fries tasted all the same just cut differently. I think it was seasoning salt used heavily on all of the fries. The burgers were OK but not memorable.This place has destroyed any and all desire I have to rent a movie from a real-live store. I can order movies on my TV, but we\\'d go to Rogers to get Blu-rays... honestly though, it\\'s just not worth it. The store is pretty much empty and has been for months like they\\'re just not replacing what they\\'re selling... I\\'m not sure if they\\'re closing or just slowly getting rid of movie rentals all together. \\n\\nWorst of all, despite having a \"dedicated\" line for tv/cell phones/internet sales, a cashier in the movie rental line will spend forever showing some idiot how their new cell phone works as if there is no lineup behind them while two other employees pretend to look super busy jostling around returned DVDs in the background... all while you wait in line for 15 minutes just to rent a friggin\\' movie.\\n\\nUPDATE:\\n\\nMy new phone day (I was eligible for an upgrade) was seriously marred by being in the Rogers Store for over an hour. They have gotten rid of all the movies and put in chairs. They are now putting in an espresso bar. \\nRogers - people do NOT want to hang out in Rogers all day. You are not the Apple store. As soon as you walk in there is a guy with a list and you get your name on \"the list\". \\nIf you go to this Rogers to pay a bill, you still get your name on the list and it is a 15-45 minute wait to pay a bill. Everytime I am there, there is a senior citizen yelling at them about waiting half an hour to pay their bill.If I could give zero stars I would. The prices are getting RIDICULOUS. They had a dresser priced at $160 that was falling apart and missing half of it\\'s hardware. There was a 1970\\'s table priced at $85 that had a corner missing! This is   a thrift store, with that pricing you could buy new at IKEA.We are closing our office been on hold over 50 minutes to cancel our service. It\\'s 2pm on a Wednesday WTH? This is a joke!As soon as you walk in the ambience warns you to leave immediately. But despite that we stayed because we bought a Groupon and wanted to try it out. The food was gross. They brought out a soup that was very salty with a burnt taste I don\\'t know what it was supposed to be obviously the chef never tries the soup it was disgusting. The salad came out with what looks like dark applesauce plopped on the top of it. My five-year-old thought it was baby throw up. The actual cook at the table was pretty good I really enjoyed it but the food wasn\\'t worth it total for four people, Groupon said it was $60 worth of food for four more people but our total was $95 with no alcohol. \\n\\nService was good that waitress was very nice and prompts. I just think this place is way overpriced for the quality of its food and the Decour. The chair that I want to sit on had food from the previous table on it and the grill was caked with Greece it was spilling in between the countertop and the grill itself.\\n\\nLastly, they charge three dollars extra for each meal if you want fried rice. They even charge the three dollar fee for a child\\'s menu to get fried rice. Outrageous!This place is subpar for the price. If I\\'m paying $50 for just a steak, I expect to have an ambiance that is nice, romantic and dressier. Not people with kids, dressed in sandals and shorts. For two and 1 glass each of wine I spent $250...for meh steak and some mashed potatoes and mushrooms. It was our anniversary and I could have spent the same at a nice restaurant and gotten an even more special experience.Do not hit this place!! Be careful with your bill! The first few times we wrote it off to mistakes...after that it seemed deliberate. Ask some of the regulars in there..consistent overcharge. We will never go back after 5 times wrong bill. Drinks are terrible! Bartender has a really bad attitude every time we have been in there. I feel like they assume that you are \"too drunk to know\". It\\'s really frustrating!! We will never be back.Horrible. We had a party there for my daughters 4th birthday on August 21 2011. \\nWe had a party\"party attendant\" who was constantly on break or MIA.I had to go find him for everything. The rest of the staff seemed to be on break as well. There was one attendant running the rides. When I asked to speak to a mgr, I was told that she wasn\\'t there and the night mgr was on their way.\\nThe bathrooms were disgusting and there was no baby changing station that I could find. I saw lady change a poopy diaper on one of the tables where you eat.\\nThe party areas floor and tables were dirty and sticky. During the eating part, no.one was around and I had to clean up everything.\\nDo not have a party here if you expect to be able to relax and enjoy it with your family and friends. Very disappointing.\\nThe kids seemed to have fun, but iy was dirty, disorganized, and unprofessional. I would choose Pump it Up anyway over this joke of a facility for a kids party.We went on Memorial Day weekend. The club in itself was nice. Big pool and a great layout. Bathrooms are nice and music was great.\\nProblem was the staff at the bag check in. Its not our fault that you had to work on a holiday weekend. Doesn\\'t mean you have to steal from peoples wallets. They put your stuff in a big plastic bag and tie it up. Theres no locker. If I had known this I wouldn\\'t have brought so much cash in my wallet. Hopefully I was only one of the few unlucky ones, but I think for such a supposed high end place, I am extremely disappointed that they have such lousy, entitled, poorly trained in customer service staff.\\nIf you truly want this to be the best pool day club, create a better bag check in system (for the amount of money the establishment gets from drink and ticket sales, I\\'m sure they could afford LOCKERS) or, hire honest people.\\nSo lesson learned, don\\'t bring cash then you might have a good time in the murky crowded pool.A patient for the past three years, with biannual check ups.  Every time I leave after my appointment I ask myself why?  Without a doubt the most screwed up business I have ever seen.  The majority of the time their computer system is down and can not schedule a follow up appointment when I leave.  Their \"central\" appointment center is a disaster.  I was on hold for over an hour and then before my call was answered, they closed!  The latest is I need a surgical clearance from CVC before I can have out patient surgery for a deviated septum.  Four trips to CVC over the past week and now their doctor wants a stress test.  They have supposedly been scheduling same for three days now.  Assuming I can ever get resolution for my surgical clearance it will be the last time I deal with this entity.Had a Groupon for gel mani. Arrived 10 minutes late at 5:10 and nail tech was with client. Was told 20 minute wait and offered morning appointment the next day. I live 20 minutes away and this was on my way home from work and it\\'s Friday so no. I waited 20 minutes because I was late myself. She was still with client so i asked front desk what time the clients appointment started. 4:15 \"because her shellac wouldn\\'t come off\". Nail tech was unapologetic. Would have appreciated the. courtesy of a phone call letting me know she was running behind. So unprofessional and rude. Won\\'t be back.Where to begin...I had a flight home that was supposed to leave at 5pm and head to Stockton and my friends were taking a flight with the same airlines to Fresno. Both flights were delayed by several hours. \\nI sat at the airport for 8+ hours as I kept getting texts saying that the flight was delayed. The people at the desk were of no help and couldn\\'t give us any reason for why the plane kept getting delayed. Their advice was to rent a car and drive home because they couldn\\'t guarantee that a plane would actually make it. They didn\\'t not accommodate us one bit for the inconvenience. All I can say is I will never be flying with this airline again and would highly suggest that no one else does either.Overrated and just ok food .. it was ultra expensive too.. avoid if you can... it\\'s better just to go to the buffet at Ceasar\\'s palace.Date of Incident: 11-5-2017\\n\\nRE: HOMEWOOD SUITES BY HILTON / VEGAS\\n\\nI will NEVER come back to the HOMEWOODS, VEGAS. It seems like a SMALL matter, but it\\'s not.  It\\'s about CUSTOMER SERVICE.  I made a SIMPLE request; can you please send someone to clean my room.  I made this request at 2 pm, 3 pm and 4 pm to NO AVAIL! I had made this same request to the cleaning staff that was across from my room at 11 am.  The reply from each front desk staff was I will call the cleaning staff and have they come to my room.  By the way, the hotel was empty.\\n\\nThe last call at 4 pm was answered by a person named Moses. He was rude, over talked me, and just NOT Nice.  He kept interrupting me and over talking me. I said to myself is this behavior supported by their manager Brandy Breault.  \\n\\nHere is the following Customer Service experience:\\n\\n1.  Unresponsiveness\\n\\n2. Rudeness\\n\\n3. No Apologies\\n\\n4. No Empathy\\n\\n5. Argumentative\\n\\n6.  Lack of Customer Service in General.\\n\\n7.  Treated like my like request was over unfounded.  A request to clean my room. Really?\\n\\nWow! Is this the Hilton Brand?  Is this how Homewood by Hilton treats their paying customers....\\n\\nWhat would you do if you were treated in such fashion?\\n\\nHilton Honor Member: 170335441I\\'ve had century link for a year now and at the there were no problems until I dropped the internet service then my phone stopped working and I waited for 4 days on my 2 days off for 2 weeks and the repair man never showed up then lied and told me I showed up and you weren\\'t home. I called century link and they blaming me I will never use them again I guess they forgot we have cell phones and home phones are obsolete in the year 2015The diner in the Silver Nugget is Hometown kitchen and let me tell you it was not the business when it came time to eat . You would have had better luck at AM/ PM or 7-11.  A party of 3 ( Us ) walk in and we are seated the waitress comes brings us water as we requested then came back and took out order .  She comes back to tell \\nE she can\\'t sub the sides to what I ordered ??  Ot would be a full charge to do that .. Why ??  I may be  the only person to not like okra ??  Any ways I change my order and then we wait ... person 1 & 2 ordered a Salisbury steak medium ,  with 2 sides a veggie blend and a baked potato  what comes out is a hamburger patty burnt cold mixed veggies and a cold baked potatoes  person 3 ordered a Rib eye  what comes out ?? A T - bone .. the manager who came out was dressed in street clothes . For all I know he could have been a customer.  He did not address the problem just laughed it off and said oh well the cook is new ... and the waitress didn\\'t know what she was serving ... just bad all\\nAround   I would not give a start if I didn\\'t have toIf I can give -0 stars I would my car has been at the NTB location and Cuyahoga Falls twice in the past month that I have the first thing had something to do with the radiator or the water pump I believe it was in the second I am with my starter being that I felt that I could trust them I took my car back there for the starter that was on October 20, 2017 I then went to go use my car had it for a day and a half and it broke down so something compelled me to go somewhere else thing I did somebody decided and the only place that my hood was NTB what they decide was that they were going to take the wires connected to my spark plugs and switch the spark plugs and also mess with my vacuum hose they lost to say it made my check engine light come on and Blake super fast I barely got it into my driveway and had to have it towed to the new place that was recommended by a friend thank goodness because now my car is running againWhy in heavens name would you do something like that to someone I don\\'t have a lot of money and I need my car to get me back and forth I like to take advantage of people when you do something like that you have no business being in business I would recommend not going there stay as far far far away if you can I don\\'t care if your car is dragging it needs immediate care find somewhere else to go you\\'ll be much better offBy far one of the worst massage places ever. The lady answered phone calls and greeyed people at the door during my massage. Moreover, my 60 min massage was only 50 mins.... \\nPlease don\\'t waste your time or money at this establishment.Terrible experience at the restaurant!! Will not be returning here!! I will recognize that it is a holiday weekend, however...they should plan on having enough staff to take care of their customers. My daughter has food allergies and the server Jennifer was not empathetic nor did she try and be accommodating. She was on the verge of being rude. She was not attentive at all. Terrible service and they insisted on charging an 18% automatic gratuity due to the size of our group (9 people). I don\\'t appreciate paying for piss poor service. \\nAs I stated before, I will NEVER return to sugar factory.I rarely leave one star reviews, but I have never had such a terrible experience with both customer service and bathroom cleanliness at a bar. \\nWe came here based on a recommendation and upon entering I thought the space was adorable. We sat at the bar which wasn\\'t super busy, and got menu\\'s. Everyone in my party ordered a beer and I asked for a Tito\\'s and soda. Since i\\'m gluten free that\\'s one of the few potato based vodkas I can drink. The bartender looked at me like I was crazy and said he had never heard of Tito\\'s. Honestly, what kind of bartender has never heard of Tito\\'s vodka?! I had just had it at a bar a block away, so I know they do carry it in Montreal. \\nSo I said ok, never mind i\\'ll find something else on the menu. My whole party was served beer, & I decided on a cider I wanted. This bartender served EVERYONE around me and purposely dodged me when I tried to get his attention to get a drink for over 25 minutes. Everyone in my group was 90% done their beer by that point. My friend who is a local also noticed what was happening and walked over to the bartender to order my drink in French. It still took over ten minutes to bring it to me. I don\\'t know what this guys problem was, or why he would not serve me. He was extremely rude for no reason at all. I can\\'t imagine he could be that butt hurt because I asked for a vodka he didn\\'t have. Who knows. \\n\\nUpon going to the bathroom I encountered fithyness even worse than the service. The women\\'s bathroom door was propped wide open.  Outside of the two small stalls was a floor covered in filthy used paper towels and garbage. Both stalls had no toilet paper whatsoever and people had used paper towels to wipe themselves, so it smelled like urine. The trash can was overflowing and there was no soap at all. The soap container had been yanked out of the wall and was sitting on the sink. Needless to say, I didn\\'t use the toilet. I\\'d imagine this is a health code violation since female employees are clearly not washing their hands unless they have a secret bathroom. \\n\\nBased on those two things, I would never recommend anyone come here. What a hot mess.Food was delicious. However waitresses were very unprofessional talking against the previous customer  next to my table laud. African American cook was rude and careless. He saw me with full plate didn\\'t care to took it for cooking and acted like no body over there.I got the foot reflexology for 45 mins. I didn\\'t expect a whole lot, but for $50 I didn\\'t expect her to be yelling at her staff the entire time. The pressure was no good. She actually started talking on the phone at one point. \\n\\nI only came here because my friend wanted to... My concerns were confirmed and I won\\'t be back.I purchased tile for my cottage from CIOT. Price was reasonable (although they quoted $1,600 to deliver! So I rented a van and took them there myself). I have 6 boxes unopened left over. It was 37 days since I bought them - past their 30 days refund by 7. I called the sales office to confirm I could return them - it\\'s a trek from downtown to their Jane Street warehouse - should be no problem I was told. I waited 4 weeks for these tiles to come in so I thought this was not unreasonable. I got to the warehouse (finally) and after waiting 20 minutes for someone named Assad to show up to the desk after being paged multiple times (seriously, the entire staff were caught up in a \"where\\'s Assad\" game - he never did show) someone named Annabelle looked at my receipt and said it was past 30 days and as per their policy they refused to take back the extra tile. Nice. CIOT sucks.Horrible customer service. Pool cleaner was extremely rude to me. Called the office right away and cancelled service.Seems like it would be pretty hard for a gas station to earn a one star rating, right? Well, at least one pump has a non-functioning auto-shutoff system. When I talked to an employee about it, he said I \"should have been paying attention\". I didn\\'t realize more attention had to be payed to a gas pump than holding it until it shut off automatically. I don\\'t mean it shut off and I kept holding it down, it never shut off once. Enjoy your 1 star!I didn\\'t come for the craft beer but for the food and it was a huge disappointment. Service was fine but I had to send my food back to have it cooked the way I originally requested. By the time I got it back the rest of my table had finished. Okay food at best.Normally I find the food here excellent.  Tonight, we ordered med rare lamb skewers delivered.  Well, the lamb was well done to burnt.  When we contacted the location, the response was \"call tomorrow when a manager is in\".  \\n\\nI took the over cooked lamb and drove to the location.  They provided a replacement order of lamb, but would not do anything about the original delivery fee.\\n\\nIt appeared that there was no manager oversight at the location and the staff are not empowered to correct these kind of issues.\\n\\nIf I want over cooked meat prepared by teenagers, I can visit the local burger joint. We call Me va me to enjoy a well prepared lamb skewers. I like to give companies a chance to fix issues. Given the lack of authority at Me va me, I will look to pick up overcooked burgers somewhere else next time.Online system down. They flaunt the ability to make an appointment. However, well good luck with that. Be sure you catch them at a good time. I\\'m sitting with an entire restaurant staff currently... Hoping to get out of here before I\\'m 50. No one answers he phone, and starting 9/29 no drug screens at this locationUnfortunately, I had to return to this dump. My neighbor is down for a few weeks after having had surgery and she called me on Saturday afternoon and asked if I could stop and pick up Chinese food for her. She said she would call and place the order. She texts me and tell me she ordered here. I was pissed!  I should have just asked what she wanted and stopped at one of the hundred Chinese spots along my route home. Of course, they are still nasty and rude (even while taking your money). I told my neighbor, only because you are sick did I stop at this restaurant. The place is dirty inside and they don\\'t deserve to be in business. I don\\'t understand how people patronize them simply because the food is cheap and tastes good. Check out Cottage, I think they are better.Liars and Crooks in disguise here.  \\n\\nGrabbed me on my way to pick up my rental from another company.  Offered me a car for $20/day.  Talked me into the insurance after I declined.  I told them I may be a little late returning, they said not to worry as there is a 59 minute grace period, it\\'s only $7/hour for the first 3 hours, then a full day charge.  The total when I walked away from the counter was $63.\\n\\nI returned the car about 25 minutes late, and expected to pay an extra hour.  On the contrary, the guy who processed my return said \"no extra charges, have a nice day\".  I walked away feeling good, and happy I found a new place to rent from.\\n\\nI got an email of my bill a couple of hours later.  $115.  I called to ask why, and like a robot, the manager Kayla just protected her staff and the charges.  \\n\\nThis is bad business and they know it.  \\n\\nNever again, stay away!I am sure this place has potential, but my one experience made the employees seem apathetic and uncaring. \\n\\nLocation: Near the Whole Foods in north Scottsdale. The woman in front of us in line was sporting all Louis Vuitton and heavy duty makeup. It\\'s the place to be. \\n\\nSelection: Tons and tons of running shoes. There were treadmills where staff members could assess one\\'s running gait and determine the best shoe.   \\n\\nService:  Lame.  There were at least five employees. One employee helped this woman and her child with a return for over 20 minutes. I had about four things to purchase.  There were other employees in the store, who could have easily assisted me.  The store lost about $50 worth of sales.   Numerous other employees could have come to help me make my purchase. \\n\\nI don\\'t know that I would return here. The experience with this one time made me think that they are not interested in helping customers.Sadly, this weekly favorite recently changed hands and the quality of the food declined. First to go were the delicious eggplant sandwiches. Tried the new veggie sandwich which sadly only contained only potatoes. Then the quality of the remaining ingredients began to decline (tabouleh with vinegar?). The result, I have been searching for another place to satisfy the hunger for a decent falafel or eggplant sandwich.Referred to Ace from American Home Shield. They scheduled appt. for Wed 1 to 5. Repairman called me on Tuesday to say he was on his way. When I said appt. was for tomorrow, he said OK. I asked if that was a problem, he said no. \\nWell, it is now 5:00 on Wednesday and no repairman. I have been calling all day to make sure someone is coming and Ace NEVER answers their phone. You must leave a message and they never call you back. \\nI did get a hold of the repairman who called me yesterday. He said he was not scheduled to my house today but he would call the office and have someone call me. Nobody has called yet and that was about an hour ago. \\nTHIS PLACE HAS TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I would never recommend them.So where do I begin, disappointment doesn\\'t fully describe our experience. We were a party of four.  The waiter explained that the portions weren\\'t \"overly large\", he was somewhat correct but he should have said they were absurdly small. I don\\'t often leave a restaurant hungry and thinking where can I stop on the way home for a quick bite.   The waiter explained that we should share the meals, but order a number of courses, which is what we did.   \\n\\nWe started with a Ceasar Salad, it was very good but small in size , our second course was an order of Barrata cheese, which also was very tasty.\\n\\nOur third course was pasta, we ordered a Cavatelli with chicken, there was barely two tablespoons of past.  Absurd,  I believe it was $18 and was supposed to be a main course and was barely an appetizer size.\\n\\nOur fourth course was Flank Steak., $35,  they first brought out steak knives that you could use to butcher the ox with, and then out came the steak. Eight or so thin strips of steak,  I mean thin, it would have been laughable if I wasn\\'t paying for it. \\n\\nThe atmosphere was very nice, and all the dishes were very tasty and well done.  The place was packed tonight but my guess is that they\\'ll be out of business in six months. No Ox got fat eating here.I waited a month and a half for my appointment only to be turned away. They asked for my Culinary insurance card and I told them that I wasn\\'t issued one nor have I ever needed to produce it before. All the other doctors/dentists that have seen me have never asked. With Culinary, the insurance is the person\\'s SSN and nothing is written on the card but the words \"Culinary Health Fund\" and the person\\'s name. No one carries their card because it\\'s useless and doctors/dentists call and verify coverage if you\\'re new to that clinic. I asked them to call and they said no. I told them I knew my number and they said no. I asked why I wasn\\'t informed a month and a half prior and the receptionist just stared at me cluelessly...I go to Starbucks almost every day this is second time I have encountered rude staff and I will definitely NEVER come back at this location. someone should probably look into this...Used to buy a lot of things here.  This has now changed as I called them to see if they had any guitar stands and straps for sale and was told they did.  I told the gentleman I would be right.  Once I got there...a gentleman attempted to help in his own unfriendly way and brought out a guitar stand I would have trashed myself.  I told him I had called and that they said they had a few stands for sale...I actually saw one marked for sale that I would have bought but this guy said it wasn\\'t for sale...it\\'s a pawn shop I said. Every thing is suppose to be for sale...I said it would have been different if I had just walked in...said I could have went to Guitar Center if I was told they didn\\'t have any...he said to me that I should have gone to f_ckin guitar center... Screw this store and their lack of professionalism...Yeah .... had a negative experience about 5 years ago.\\n\\nNEVER PURCHASE EXTENDED WARRANTIES.\\nThis applies to TV\\'s, furniture, tires, etc.\\nBURNING YOUR OWN MONEY ..... WILL GIVE YOU GREATER PLEASURE ..... THEN DEALING WITH THESE GOONS !!!DO NOT USE THIS LENS CRAFTERS!  We paid a lot of money for prescription sunglasses and eye glasses!  We live 40 minutes away!  I received a text that my glasses are in.  My husband drove to pick them up?  They told him they only have my sunglasses!  He leaves 10 minutes later I get a text glasses are in!  My other glasses were ther. THEY NEVER EVEN LOOKED!  We will never use this place again!  Unfortunately the Pearson eye group also will lose us as Customers!  Terrible customer service!  We spend over $1000 a year at Lens Crafters!  Not anymore!The racks were not well taken care of and the two guys working on the mens floor were playing grab ass and couldn\\'t be bothered. \\n\\nI scanned the racks looking for my size. It was difficult because nothing is in order. The sizes are all mixed up. I tried on a few items but decided to pass. The entire 45 minutes I was there not one employee ever said anything to me. \\n\\nIt was like going to my first high end swap meet. I will never go back.This company replaced the opener motor last year. Initially they charged way too much, and ended up issuing a partial refund of a couple hundred dollars. Last night just after 5p the garage door wouldn\\'t open, so I called them as I thought it could be related to the new opener.  The guy tells me both springs are broken.  He charged $375 to install two new springs, and it took him less than an hour.  In just researching the average cost of parts and labor for two springs, the average cost is $180-$250.  Wow.  As you can see, significant OVERCHARGING is a common practice with these people.  Do yourself a favor and find someone else.  I wish I would have done my research first, though it\\'s pretty inconvenient when someone is there and can do it and you don\\'t have time to research and eff around trying to schedule someone.  It\\'d be nice if this company had integrity and charged fair market value.Food is ok, but the portion is half of chipotle for the same price. Staff is what I give the one star for. Not helpful and rude. I asked for a cup of water and the cashier pointed to the cups with an expression on her face that said \"how could you not see those, take one.\" \\n\\nI will never come here againCab driver had his cell phone stolen, so he didn\\'t have direction on where we were going. The heater was on in the car and the windows in the back were broken. The car light was ripped out, dirty no English! Horrible ride, almost died 2x. He did try to make small talk.WORST dining experience I can remember in years.\\n\\nFood was okay, service was slow.  You could tell the wait staff was embarrassed.  They apologized, offered  free drinks, yet were so slow, never delivered on the promise.  We did the tasting menu, and I did not like one dish, took one bite and pushed away (Pork Belly, I am usually a fan).  Wait staff was so behind, my full plate was not even questioned. \\n\\nI would have understood a bad night, but the fact that Rick Moonens was in the dining room enjoying drinks with friends while his staff struggled really left a \\'bad taste in my mouth.\\'  Poor showing.NO DRINK MENU and really RUDE BARTENDER.\\n\\nWhy not? I know it\\'s quite a busy bar, but they should still have a drink menu in my opinion. We are not familiar with cocktail drinks and since we got 2 complimentary drinks for Staying at The Monte Carlo, we thought of maybe trying something different than my usual virgin pina colada and margarita.  \\n\\nWe were not greeted at all when we sat at the bar, it wasn\\'t too busy, but the bartender looked at us and didn\\'t say anything. Maybe because we were holding  our \"free drink coupon\"? I didn\\'t want to assume. But when we got one bartender\\'s attention, we asked for a drink menu and said they didn\\'t have any then walked away. When we got his attention again and asked if he recommended a drink and I swear, he said \"umm..I dunno Mai Tai?\" in a rude tone. What\\'s up with the attitude? I had to raise my voice and asked the same question and his attitude changed a bit, and pushed for a Mai Tai.\\n\\nSo yes, we got a Mai Tai and a Margarita. Both were disgusting. I don\\'t know what a Mai Tai supposed to taste like but it was very bitter. The Margarita was bitter too and was all alcohol. \\n\\nSo disappointed!!!!Today I had a flight out of Ashville that was canceled because of mechanical issues.  Seems like they have issues with keeping up with their planes.  They used to be a cheap airlines, but now they cost the same,  and you don\\'t even get to leave the day you paid for.....  I don\\'t recommend using this airlinesThis store is awful. The dressing rooms are hot and dirty, the employees never greeted me or asked if I needed anything until I got till the register, no one knew where anything was, employees lacked common courtesy and training, and the bathrooms look like the haven\\'t seen a good cleaning or renovation since the 90s.\\n\\nForever 21 should have stuck with small stores. I will not be shopping at the Arrowhead location ever again.Update - it\\'s been over two months. I received an email from the assistant general manager on June 10 and responded via the phone number left for him. I did not receive a call back. Today I finally reach the general manager who acknowledge the accident and is finally turning this over to their insurance company. The jury is still out as to how this will be resolved. I\\'m not a litigious person - but I feel that the holiday inn should be paying for me to seek further medical attention for the injury caused by their negligence.I am all for supporting local small businesses in my communi, butafter having one of my $50 dress shirts sliced in the same two spots on each sleeve by Starmount cleaners i would never return. The owner is very rude, denied damaging my shirt and tried telling me the shirt wore out. Obviously they are dishonest, and are not concerned with long term customer satisfaction. Further, they do their own dry cleaning in-house and do not do as good of a job as the ones who send it out. Avoid this place at all costs. If they damage or loose your items they will leave you out to dry, literally.Been a policy holder for 20 years but had to cancel due poor customer service.  The IQ level in that office is questionable along with not giving a flip about giving  professional service.   Cie Taylor is partially retired and the clowns are running her business in the ground.HORRIBLE BARTENDER. We will not be back.  We stopped in on Tuesday, March 14 about 7pm. The young, thin bartender said hello. We sat at the far end of bar, then he proceeded to ignore us for the next ten minutes because he was sitting on the beer cooler, talking to 4 friends. I leaned over a couple times to see if I could catch his attention. Nope. So I walked down to where his friends were sitting and stood there (not in an a-hole way...just in a hey there, I\\'m here way)  He continued to talk to his friends. I finally turned to walk away and I heard him say oh I\\'ll be right there. Another few minutes passed and still he\\'s chatting up his buddies. We left and spent our money (and a lot of it) at another bar. We are not a-holes...we\\'ve both worked in the service industry, so we \"get\" when you are busy. This guy was not.I eat at the Waffle House  periodically.  But this location profiles clients.  When arriving to the waffle house we were given a regular menue.  Then I noticed all the ither customers were getting the all you can eat menu.   When I askes the waitress for the all you can eat menu she ignored me.  So I thought she didn\\'t hear me and asked her again.  It was very obvious that she didn\\'t want me to order off that menu.   They were only for certain customers.   So we left and I hear the waitress say she was rude.  Really!!!  If you haven\\'t noticed we are in the 20th century.   Were that traylor trash hillbillies bull isn\\'t excepted anymore. I won\\'t be.back shame on you.Don\\'t go. \\nPaid for unlimited for 4 kids. Bumper boats and go carts closed at 9. Park open until 10. We were not told the rides closed early until after tickets were purchased. Sign is posted inside park, not at entrance. Many angry parents and disappointed kids.Wow is right. And Bow is apparently what you have to do to them in order to be a client. Once I recovered from the stench coming in the door to this place, I was immediately assaulted by their long list of things I MUST do. Note to management- As a prospective client, I MUST do nothing.   Leave your shelter attitude at home. Oh wait, I\\'ve actually been to many friendlier shelters. \\nI was NOT allowed to see the potty area, I was not allowed to see the play area, and contrary to their website, my dogs MUST be thrown in with the community against my will, exposing them to god-knows-what risks from other dogs and the diseases they might carry (based on smell of the place).  So, you see the only thing I MUST do, is leave this review to warn others against ever trusted your beloved pets to this business.Stayed here while working at Sky Harbor, just not worth the money. No privacy to close, horrible internet, cable is as basic as you can get. And dogs barking 24/7 right behind park. And line mariachi music until 10 pm in evenings. Better places for your money.Ok well Im a homeless man that just found work again but I dont have a pot to piss in and I sleep on concrete but Im trying to get better.Anyway I know they were trying to get ready to close an hour n a half later but on Saturday Feb 10 between 8:30 and 9:00 I had an upset stomache and really had to use the restroom. I tried to be descrete when I walked in but already knew 1 employee was mad. They all can go home and use the bathroom when they feel like it. I dont have 1 working to change that.Normally I would have purchased a whole meal because I had the money but I just bought a soda in the hopes to charge my phone really quick cause No home. Anyone else they wouldnt treat like that. Keep in mind I even told the manager that walked in and asked if I was doing drugs or if I was sure I was using the bathroom when I was washing my hands that I dont have a bathroom and I just detoxed myself the other day to make sure and got a job.while I was in there the other employees were mad talking about how I was in there for a half hour but I had to. I already sleep outside in the cold on concrete.So I didnt buy a meal like I was going to and bought a soda and the machines were off in the middle of that the employees quiet looking upset and the manager asking about my watches like she was trying to identify me made me feel uncomfortable. Like I said when they have an upset stomache they can go home and use the bathroom.I was a customer that would have bought more but shortly after sitting there in silence and tension for a few minutes I poured it out and left.I went back out to lay my head in the cold on concrete and try to charge my pheone elsewhere when I could have bought more food. The toilet scrubber was in there and I even made sure it was still clean. This is why when you are stuck on your low people make it impossible for you to get back up.I was judged from the moment I walked in.They wouldnt do any other customer like that. Just me because Im homeless trying to get back up and noone wants you to do that. Ill give her 1 star for still being cool enough to let me sit there and buy a soda.We used to love the Mad Cactus 15 years ago, it was great -- until it just wasn\\'t.  So after seeing the renovations and changes on the Food Network we were excited to give it another try.  Unfortunately the only thing that changed was the decor.\\n\\nThe food was absolutely terrible and the place was dirty.  I paid $3 for a small bowl of over salted chips and went to the salsa bar.  The sneeze guard over the salsa bar was so dusty and dirty that I could have written my name in it.  We were seated in a booth next to the restrooms and the light-switch on the wall that was in our booth was so filthy it made me question the cleanliness of the rest of the restaurant.\\n\\nI had the puffy tacos and when I picked them up, so much water ran off of them that it made the taco soggy and mushy.  The rice was dry and inedible, like it was made days ago.  My husband and I also had margaritas which were completely tasteless.  He had the original and I had the chipotle pineapple.   I tasted both and they were nearly identical in watery flavor.\\n\\nThe food network wasted it\\'s money because nothing has changed.  We will not be going back.I\\'m afraid the  reviews for this company were all written by its owners and employees. All 5 stars? Normally, people write reviews to complain about something went bad. Suspicious...My quick tip says it all...over-hyped, over-priced, and the service is terrible.\\n\\nI think I\\'m just too old to thoroughly enjoy the beach club scene.  I knew I wouldn\\'t enjoy it as general admission (I don\\'t know if I would have enjoyed it when I was 21 either) so my party opted to make reservations several weeks in advance for a cabana.  We got a \"deal\" through a VIP host but were still shelling out a hefty sum to have a bit of shade and respite from the crowds.  The contract said to arrive by 11:30am to honor our reservation and also stated that if we didn\\'t show, we would be charged $1500 for a missed reservation.  The majority of my group showed up at 11am (when they opened) and proceeded to wait in line for almost an hour.  The line wasn\\'t that long but the promoters outright ignored us and attended to people around us.  When someone finally acknowledged us, our reservation was completely messed up and in order for us to get something similar to our original reservation (but still a downgrade), we had to pay an extra $1000 over our original price.\\n\\nI nearly lost it when they continued to make us wait...I vocalized my frustration and we were finally escorted to our cabana.  What a disappointment!!!  The cabanas range from $3000 to $10,000 and it\\'s basically just a room and an adjacent day bed overlooking the beach club.  I was grateful to have a cool place to rest when I couldn\\'t handle the heat any longer and didn\\'t want to risk catching an STD in the pool that my friend deemed \"people soup.\"  We ordered copious amounts of food, drinks, bottles of water, ice cream, magnums of champagne...everything we could to meet the minimum and cover our cabana fee.  It was the definition of opulence and wastefulness.  I felt a little bit like Marie Antoinette.\\n\\nOur VIP host found me after we were settled in our cabana and apologized for the confusion but could do nothing about the extra $1000 or the down-graded cabana.  It was an empty apology.  She was contrite with me but gave my husband attitude, saying that she was embarrassed because we ruined her relationship with the people at the club.  I found this to be completely unprofessional and if she had just shown up on time, she could have saved her own relationships.\\n\\nI really expected better service from a hotel like Encore.  This experience really left a sour taste in my mouth and I would check out the beach club at Marquee over Encore in a heartbeat.We were regulars. Then...new owners take over and slowly started changing recipes and using sub-par ingredients. There is so much competition in the area. Won\\'t go back ever again.Bryce sounded caring on the phone and kept promising that he\\'d help me take care of the pool but it all fell through at the end. He first charged me $800+ to change my filter and drain + acid wash my pool. The pool was ok for a month and then the water level got too low so the water turned green again. I kept trying to find him to help me get the water level back but he was no where to be found.I come to Arizona to visit my brother and wife for NYE and had the WORST NYE at this bar...\\n\\nI stayed for four days and the first day i came down I checked this place out with my brother. The man that works to the right side of the bar was flirting with me the whole time, I just thought that he was being nice trying to make his tips and stuff until I ended up throwing up. I was under the impression I was ordering 9$ patron shots I ended up spending 60$ on them...Next day my brother and I were talking and he told me the reason I threw up was because I was drinking nothing but \"well\" drinks which are only supposed to be 3 bucks or something..So the bartender ripped me off and got me sick :(( I came 2 days later on NYE and confronted him and he just laughed at me! I tipped him good too like 10 bucks uggh such a ghetto feeling I had..Anyways 2 hours into the night right after 12 pm my bf wanted to go smoke a cig outside in the patio and accidentally brought it in cause he was a bit faded and this african american security guard put my bf in a head lock and was dragging him outside..My bf was not resisting or anything of the sort. I mean couldnt you have just said hey man you cant smoke it here you gotta leave or hey just dont smoke..Its not like he was being violent or anything! Anyways, once I saw the bouncer choking my bf, I ran after to tell him to stop hurting him and he kicked me out and called me fat. I left my purse inside and I asked if I could get it and he said no fat girl, just kept saying that. After about 10 mins or so of yelling and stuff I finally gave up and went to the front to have my brother look for it and it was missing. Stolen! My night ended there and I took a cab home. \\n\\nSo in conclusion, if you are coming out to AZ I would deff not recommend this bar to anyone. My brother was talking to a man who said he was going to be a manager there in a couple months and he was super nice buying him drinks and stuff and he was telling my brother about how much work needed be done to clean this place up. I really hope he makes a change cause this place has potential! I love to dance and this aspect is what initially attracted me to come here. If you come within the next 2 months expect the same or worse to happen to you..getting ripped off, chocked out for no reason, kicked out for no reason, called bad names, and having your belongings held hostage. Im still traumatized by this place, hopefully Ill get over it soon and hopefully the new owner steps in and makes this place shine like it should! :)I wouldn\\'t recommend this hotel even to my worst enemy. Stayed at the Venezia tower the first two nights and was woken up every morning at 5am from a door slamming. Our room was at the end of the hallway and the door that was being slammed I believe was a janitors closet or some kind of employee exit. The slamming wasn\\'t just once but every 5-10 minutes. Come on people it\\'s vegas people don\\'t sleep until 5am. Called the front desk and they moved me rooms into the Venetian tower...... Glad that we were moved but there was a problem in that room as well. Us girls started to get ready for the night and as I was showering the water wasn\\'t going down the drain. Called the front desk again they said they will have someone fix it. I told them we don\\'t have time we need to get ready for the night. The lady then said call back after your done getting ready and we will send someone up. SERIOUSLY gross who wants to take a shower standing in water that isn\\'t going down the drain after someone showers. Seriously lady. She finally said they will move us again for the second time. Moved into the new room and of course something else is wrong with it. The bathroom door doesn\\'t close and the toilet doesn\\'t flush right. For all this money we spent at this hotel I rather would have stayed at the Luxor and gotten a suit. The lady at the front desk was rude as well and didn\\'t want to help out. The only reason I have one star was because I couldn\\'t give a negative one. Never coming here again.Terrible place- ordered iced green tea and tried to order one of the juice/smoothies options. They are out of my first 3 choices, finally order something that supposedly they are not out of- guess what, 2 minutes later they are out of it as well. At this point I just want to walk away but my bf really wants something so he decides on latte. We step aside and wait- 5 minutes later we hear- what was your order? Tea? Black or green? My iced tea arrives lukewarm and my coffee loving bf decides to throw the latte away as it is disgusting. In their defense- it was almost closing time but this whole situation could have been handled so much better.Very crowded. Didn\\'t have the beer I wanted that was listed on the CHALKBOARD which is so easy to change. Terrible service. Only two servers on Saturday night? Last call at midnight not announced. Refused to serve at 12:01. Never going back.My bf rented a VERSA for 48hrs/2days because his main car broke down and he needed a car to get to work, the quote was $44.  He declined everything that was offered. He specifically refused insurance because his would cover it. When he returned the car, he was charged $111. THEY ADDED INSURANCE WITHOUT HIS CONSENT at $25.99 per day.  Representative that helped him was \"Devry\", (at least that\\'s what he said his name was) \\n\\nNever doing business with them again. Why do they do \"Bait & Switch\"??!?!! This is so wrong!The food was gross ( amazing costumer service ) but the food was a complete miss got some carne asada nachos and it was the worst nachos I\\'ve ever tried, wrenched in chipotle sauce and not to mention the price, I don\\'t really mind payng for pricey food if it\\'s worth it but I would not even pay 5$ for those nachos againThis guy should find a different job where he does not come into contact with people.\\nRUDEMaybe greet your customer next time I walk in and not stand at the other register and just look at me like I\\'m supposed to read your mind.  One of my go to places but at times the customer service is horrendous!I have been waiting a while to write this review because I was torn. I am always on the hunt for farm fresh, healthy food. I find that the west valley is seriously lacking in this type of cuisine. I think it is a great idea to bring this here, and if it was done right, it would be successful. For example, Paradise and Jasons deli are always packed. Also a Wildflower bread is on its way, and I think it will do well. \\nI think Field Kitchen would have done a lot better if it was opened in its own location, and not taking out a crowd favorite of Sweet tomatoes. There are many loyal sweet tomatoes customers who are upset about the change. Try this in an empty building, don\\'t take peoples favorite thing away. This building was not designed for their new concept and just trying to fit it in the cheapest way possible. The flow and feel of a restaurant is very important. It sets the whole foundation for the experience. The flow here is off like many reviewers have pointed out. What was a good idea, had poor execution. \\nAnyways, we went to this on the opening day. I was excited but wary because of the change and the increase in prices. Again, I would have been a lot more excited if it wasnt at the expense of the normal sweet tomatoes and at a separate place. But being the food adventurer and wanting something healthy, we wanted to give it a shot. The first thing my husband noticed was the change of staff. There were a lot of hipster young kids. I am not sure where they came from, maybe somewhere in the east valley. I guess they are trying to market towards a younger edgier crowd than the traditional patrons. We went through the same spiel as the others when we sat down. It was a confusing concept but we got it. I am not a fan of confusing concepts but they dont break it for me. For example, I still love Paradise even though the different stations are a little confusing too but maybe because I was introduced to Panera first and they have a better flow. \\nAnyways, my parents went first. My dad is hard of hearing, and I don\\'t think he got it, and he got frustrated and just ended up with a bowl of chili and did not want to go back to get something else. So he was pretty hungry by the end. My mom ordered one of the gourmet salads. She was very disappointed. She ordered a chef salad, and there was barely anything on it. I think they missed half of the ingredients, and put some flaccid meat on it. It was a terrible looking sad face salad.\\nNext, we went up. I wanted to try one of their gourmet salads. The salad maker was so excited that I wanted to try one because not many people were, but then I asked if soup and stuff were included and was told No. Um, what? I am paying a premium price for this salad and I can\\'t hit the soup bar? That is messed up to me, especially since you order in the same line. So I cancelled that, and got the soup and salad bar.\\nMy salad was good. I can\\'t think of any topping I was missing. I did miss the premade salads like the asiago cesear and coleslaws. I got the the dressing spinner, and picked out a dressing. I didnt like that the dressing went all over the bowl, I had some things that I did not want dressing on. It was annoying, and I mean seriously, paying someone to do that is a waste. \\nThen,  I got to the 3 soup choices. I was thoroughly disappointed that I could have soup or macaroni and cheese.  \\nI also did not like that it wasn\\'t all you can eat. Most salad bars are all you can eat. That is the appeal of having to make your own salad, so you can try different things. Jason\\'s deli has a small salad bar, but its delicious and you can go back. What are they doing differently that Field Kitchen cant do? \\nThe bread station was good. I didnt taste any difference in the butters. It seemed like a marketing trick to think you are getting gourmet butter, but there is really nothing different or special.\\nWe didn\\'t bother with the yogurt. Our experience was just lacking that we wanted to get out of there.\\nIts sad. I think that it was a poor execution to try and get more money out of their customers and they took a crowd favorite out. Now we will never have a sweet tomatoes by us. \\nWe have gone to the metrocenter one a few times, but not to the extent we were frequenting the Arrowhead location. \\n\\nWill we be back? Probably not, I will just go to Jason\\'s Deli, Paradise, or Wildflower.Will never return. Rudest bartender and staff I have encountered. Ordered take out for lunch on St. Patty\\'s day and it was obviously inconvenient for them. Menu wasn\\'t available online only last year\\'s.  When I came to pick my order up it wasn\\'t even busy..... Very overpriced and extremely small portions.....Worst fajitas I\\'ve ever had, totally bland. Side of rice in a Dixie cup!! 18.00 to share the worst fajitas I\\'ve ever had. Zero flavor. My boyfriends brother got the meatloaf, it tasted just like how canned dog food smells. All bad. I didn\\'t like Toby before, now i feel ripped off by him. Highway robbery! It doesn\\'t get worse than sides in Dixie cups, it was similar to convalescent home food, for those on a salt free, spice free diet. this place is a ramshackle.I had a similar experience that Amanda F. had. The first time I came here it was decent, i would have given this place 5 stars if it were like the first time each time. I had previously gone to the Tempe location and noted that this place seemed much more clean and organized. For your first time, or your return after being absent for a long time like myself, you go through the orientation which can take 3+ hours. After that, and a sort of physical (asking questions and blood test) they then start the actual process. The first time here was odd because they had to stick me twice. They said I needed to drink more water the next time I come in, must have been some dehydration issue. But eventually everything worked it...for this first time.\\n\\nI came back the following weekend and was one of the first several people there. This time, they stuck me and messed up. They did it completely wrong because when it started returning blood it wasn\\'t going into the right place but forming a \"bubble\" of blood in my arm! I had to holler out for them to take care of the issue. They then tried sticking me again but \"missed\", and started to basically try again and again like they were using my arm for practice. It was like they were guessing where my veins were and just poking in hoping to hit something. They quit once they noticed I wasn\\'t liking this and had me lay down with some water and not return for a couple months. I haven\\'t been back and don\\'t ever intend to.\\n\\nThis place has given me a fear of needles that I never had before. Just a couple people know what they\\'re doing. They all seem to be fresh out of school or something. Stay away!One of the WORST, WORST experience I\\'ve had with a company.. Called and spoke w/ Callie 1st thing I asked was \"do you do free estimate..?\" She said yes so went ahead and explain the issue and set the appt... When the service guy came thur said it\\'s was going to be about 260, told him okay thanks let me think about it.. That\\'s when he said there\\'s a 65 service charge, and would get in trouble if he didn\\'t collect the fee.. So pretty much was forced in a corner, so just got it done.. Service guy did knock off the cost, can\\'t blame him he didn\\'t take the call.. When talking to Callie she gave me BS excuse about this \"service fee\".. Just a total headache, avoid this company!!!!UPDATE\\nI am at SNS now and something is very wrong. I\\'ve had to send back my meal twice so far. The manager looks and is acting high and the other manager is too busy making and serving her family to my left. \\n\\nThe family manager just came by and said she was sorry and took it off my bill then served her family at the same time. Wow. Never again will I come back. Sonic is next door and way better than this. \\n\\nI have to write this review. I am/was regular at SnS in Brunswick, but something happened recently with the staff that has caused me to write this review. They are unkempt, rude, ignorant to the menu and quite frankly act like a bunch of school girls in the hall. \\n\\nI love the garlic double burger there but without the garlic spread. So in other words a burger with the garlic salt on top of the bun. \\n\\nSo that\\'s what I ordered. My girlfriend ordered a Frisco and it was fairly slow that evening. Our waitress took the order and came back with the food some few minutes later and that\\'s when I realized that it had the garlic sauce on it. I asked her about it and she became flustered. I was not rude, just asked her what it was as I normally get it the way I described above. She then, without saying another word took my plate and went in the back. She came back 2 minutes later with a bun and two plain patties. I started to ask her a question about it, but then just asked her for a slice of cheese and the manager. \\n\\nShe went over to the grill person where everyone gathered to hear her speak. Then watched as the manager who was a part of the group, a person I\\'d never seen before, came over and told us that she, the waitress, was new and didn\\'t understand the menu.  The manager, who was pregnant, told us that she doesn\\'t really care for the meat quality anyway and won\\'t eat there. Maybe she said that, because we didn\\'t ask anything close to anything like that, because she was pregnant and I\\'ve heard of people saying certain foods can be off putting when pregnant, but the whole experience was surreal!\\n\\nWe were both baffled and now clearly frustrated. We ate the fries and left. Waste of $$ and time. Steak and Shake has lost our business. When and if they ever decide to hire people that actually read there own menu or eat there own food then we may consider going back. Until then, I\\'ll go elsewhere to spend my hard earned money!The worst Mexican my girlfriend and I have ever had! Just thrown together. Couldn\\'t find our enchilada in the mess of beans, rice and whatever. Greasy hard shell tacos, they sucked. And to top it all off.... EXPENSIVE!. Don\\'t even bother wasting your time and money.My 20 minute wait turned in to 2 hours and just before I was called back I saw a small note saying the provider was not a medical doctor, but a Physician\\'s Assistant. At one point I asked if they had a room where I could go lie down (so I wouldn\\'t fall down). I was told no, they had to keep rooms open for emergencies. So wait, my dizzy and feel like passing out isn\\'t emergent enough? Sheesh. A 2-hour wait with a mere 4 patients in the waiting room is ridiculous. If I hadn\\'t felt so yucky I would have left. Unless they make some changes, I recommend finding another urgent care.I have tried on 4 different occasions to contact someone at Ashley Manor. I have called 4 times over 3 weeks during their business hours and left messages and no one has called me back.\\nI am very sad because it looked beautiful in the pictures and I was hoping to have my wedding there. But if I can\\'t even get someone to return my call for over a month I certainly wont trust them with something as important as my wedding!They have absolutely not one ounce of ability to direct traffic or organize the vehicles as for easy exit. It took 2 hours and 25 minutes just to leave the parking lot. I\\'ve been to concerts, football games, baseball, hockey, basketball, rodeo, monster truck, college football bowl games and the Indy 500 NONE took more than 30 mins to leave, NASCAR should drop Las Vegas Motor Speedway from the series.Rude host, more than 10 tables open and told 20 minute wait.  Walked out and got right into a restaraunt that was busier.  Don\\'t waste your time, go somewhere that they want to work and please their guests.i purchase a laptop from frys.com on black Friday,  i receive the item 3 months later they said it was a back up order, the lap top didnt work. i couldn\\'t put the windows key, i had to call frys, dell, Microsoft, and everybody was telling me to call the other party. finally i find the 3 rd party who sell the laptop using frys.com, they couldn\\'t work the code either and while were fixing it the laptop keep going black , so they said they will send another one, i receive the second one on march and exact same thing happen, screen goes dark. i call frys they said it is more than 30 days since they shipped the item and the 3rd company said its more than 6 months that they sold it,and i haven\\'t been able to use this garbage 10 minute, \\nfrys should be ashamed of its way of doing business last time they have my money.11/29/14 our family upgraded phones, in the process, sales person offered free samsung tablets only needed to pay tax on it-$19.08. We asked a few questions because it sounded too good to be true but he assured us that no fee will be added onto our account, cause it runs on wifi. So we purchased 4 tablets for each of us in our family share plan. Few day later I called sprint billing dept. for non related questions and found out that sales person totally misled us, also found out sprint charged 3 tablets $720.00 on our acct as past due, pay now. With multiple phone calls to sprint billing dept and visit 3 times to store, finally i was able to get 720.00 off my acct on 12/9/14 with billing dept with Christina -best customer service person.\\n\\n4th Tablet returned by my son 12/10/14 well within return period policy, same day my on line bill shows 240.00 as charge, also in red ink warning pay past due now or will be subject to collection activities and service interruption. Today is 12/17/14, after multiple phone calls to billing dept , i was passed around to different depts and a couple of reps gave me an absurd reason for not getting the refund i.e. takes 3-5day, 3-5 billing cycles??? for need to check warehouse for return merchandise, on and on.\\nI probably have to pay $240.00 tablet we don\\'t have in order to prevent \"collection activities or service interruption\". I have been very patient to try to understand through this ordeal but I am very disappointed at the sprint system. Such a big corporation can\\'t even take care of a refund??? i had sprint service for over four years and never had a late payment. Be aware of sales people\\'s special promotions!  my experience with most of them are very helpful but need to watch out for some.... My complaints are more to corporate refund system, original sales person and billing dept. other sales people were trying to help me get 4th tablet refund but they couldn\\'t resolve.The worst receptionists are rude and unhelpful. Had an appointment with Dr. Terrance Kwiatkowski waited over an hour and no one would tell me when I would get to see him. They do not waste a minute getting your money!! A disorganized rip off.-10 love Dickey\\'s in Texas so we thought we\\'d try at home and for the love of god ppl this is crap! We order 42$ worth of meat and sides paid for 3 meat plater and got 2. Half of the sides we ordered are wrong. When my wife picked up the order the ppl behind the counter were making fun of customers.My boyfriend and I came for the yard long margaritas. We were disappointed because they ran out of the yard long cups. The margaritas tasted good but they literally had no alcohol which was unfortunate considering how expensive the drinks were.Ridiculous place to shop service-wise. \\nThis is a pretty large store with quite a bit of inventory. 3 guys were working this evening but \"keeping busy\" to seemingly avoid customers. People were standing around just begging with their eyes to be noticed!\\nWe went in quickly to grab a bow tie for hubby for our X-mas party. In and out turned into 20 minutes of just waiting at the cash register to pay!\\nDeplorable. And to think how much $ we spent here for our wedding (North Hill location)  to see this store go downhill like this.\\nThe man who finally checked us out never apologized for our wait . He did advise that someone had called in sick but all the more reason to kick it up a notch, no?\\nNo thank you for our purchase, we just could not wait to get out of there.Went there with a friend on a recent trip to Toronto. The food is good, the music is great, and the drinks are cheap. It has a small stage in the center with lots of room for dancing. My problem, though, was with the management. When I complained about a particular male customer who was harassing me and my friend, the manager just shrugged it off.  We wound up having to leave early to get away from the jerk who was bothering us.  It\\'s a shame because we were having a good time until then. I don\\'t think I\\'ll be going back on my next visit.Joined the husbands for a happy hour after golf and the drinks were horrendous! I ordered the French 75 which came out totally flat. I kindly asked the waiter if they could open a new bottle of bubbly and she said yes of course. The new drink came back and the only difference is that they added Sprite. It was actually kind of insulting. I finally asked for a wine which I\\'m willing to bet my bottom dollar that it totally came from a box. The food was gross and over fried. Long story short, if you\\'re not 85 years old and only looking for a cheap beer and shotty service, don\\'t waste your time.The line here is always 15 20 minutes.  Getting fabric cut can be 30+ minutes. The employees are not knowledgable.  This store is a pot the swallows hours of your time. This is a regular occurrence.  Something should change.Unfortunately you can\\'t do zero stars. 15 min wait and three people to figure out seating on an open empty restaurant. I can see why they are empty. Service like that to seat can only go downhill when it comes to the food service and the food itself. Stay away!!!Yuck Where do I start?? First the service was mediocre. I used to come here all the time for years and never had a problem until tonight. Everything was just bland. The fried avocado roll and the Japanese lasagne were terrible. This place used to be good. I was excited to come here after seeing they brought back the 50% happy hour on the weekends. We tried the green tea cheesecake and it was disgusting tasted old and hard. Don\\'t come hereSlowest and worst customer service EVER. \\nALWAYS under staffed always SLOOOW. I am standing in line now theu have been open since 7 am it is 7:10 there are over 10 people checked in at the keyosk and on line waiting for vitals to be taken. There are three  people at the vitals station and they are all talking amongst themselves as 12 people are now in lone waiting. ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE. They have the monopoly for 2 reasons. We are need the money that badly in this economy and they are the only facility in this area. Shameful.WORST SERVICE EVER . AVOID AVOID AVOID \\n\\nI came here for my birthday dinner and made a reservation for 10 .when we arrived we got two tables one got all you can eat and another got the woonam and couple choice. Each one you can choose 3 meats and get soy bean soup. So while we were ordering our meats ( that was available on both sections ) she was saying how we choose too much from one list , so we ordered 4 meats and two portions of two of them.\\n\\n- we asked for water, received it after 20 minutes of asking and we never saw them again \\n-asked for soybean paste never got it \\n\\nAs we started getting full I noticed that we had only gotten one soy bean soup and nothing else, later when I had to go pay I asked about our soups and she said \"oh, you didn\\'t get it, I guess I left it at the wrong table \" like wtf? not even an apologize.\\nAfter we received the check and people pulled out cards and cash she started to sigh and look annoyed so I just paid and left. It wasn\\'t until after we paid and left we realized we never got one of the meats. \\n\\nThis is out raging how horrible the service is , the food was good but it can\\'t make up for how horrible the service was .The customer service here was pretty awful. We waited on a pool table and had a couple of guys that shared the table with us that were super nice. We were halfway through our last game and someone came up to our table and said \"come on, Finish up your game guys we\\'re closing up.\" This was about 15 minutes before they closed. At about 5 til close they asked up again and I admittedly got a little short because I just wanted finish my game and leave. They were very rude about us finishing our game said \"the upstairs closes at two so hurry up.\" I brought up that we were still customers and they pretty much didn\\'t care. I understand trying to close down, but My companion and I have both been bartenders and this was rudest customer service I\\'ve ever had in my entire life. There were still people standing at the bar while they were pestering us to get out. I will not go back.Worst Walmart customer service ever. I ordered for pick up at this location (Biggest mistake of my life). Called their phone number for the pick up and no one picked up. An customer service manager came to assist me and she sent out the most useless worker to back to get my order. Believe it or not it took her 40 minutes to get my item while I was standing the whole time. AVOID THIS WALMART AT ALL COSTS GO TO THE ONE IN KEELE AND LAWRENCE.Came in here for the first time and was disappointed.  I ordered a simple pour over drip coffee and picked 12 oz size, since this place looks fancy I thought they will do drip coffee fresh for me, but I saw them went to the back, and just pour in the left over coffee they\\'ve made (not sure how long ago) into my cup, when I received the cup it feels light, so I opened it and notice it\\'s not even 75% full, so I asked the barista nicely if he can please refill it for me since I paid for 12 oz and NOT less than 8 oz, he went back and brew me some more fresh one....but my goodness, how lazy can you be? I\\'m very disappointed and will not ever come back.Stay away!!! It took 7 tries to get a very simple order at the drive thru, and they STILL managed to mess it up. The cashier at the window copped an attitude when I tried to check to see if I got what I ordered, she told me to pull forward. I asked to speak to the manager, it turns out SHE TOOK MY ORDER! I asked for the number of the district manager, and for n=both of their names (they don\\'t wear name tags...). I called the number she gave me, and this person told me I could come to another location to get the right food....which would entail at least 30 minutes round trip. And, he never even attempted to apologize for the horrible service. Don\\'t even bother trying this place!!!!!Gosh, I guess you really get what you pay for. I have tried this place twice (my fault for thinking the first bad experience was a fluke). The first time - the car\\'s warning lights started going off - of course, after I was about 100 miles out of the area on my way down to CA. The cars are OLD and NOT WELL MAINTAINED. The second time - there was no one at the counter. Just a phone number to call if you happen to show up. I call them and wait ... and wait... and wait... I actually waited for about a full 15 minutes, feeling extremely stupid - how can they advertise 24 hour service, if no one\\'s at the counter and no one shows up? I ended up just heading over to another car counter and booking a car there. After the end of my booking (another 15 minutes), I looked over, and STILL, NOBODY HAD SHOWN UP! Don\\'t waste your time - just spend another 5 bucks per day and go to a different car rental there.Tried this restaurant for the first time today.\\nOur salad was the highlight of the meal\\nWe ordered the Regina Margarita pizza and added mushrooms and pepperoni. The pizza had tomato sauce. 6 pieces of mozzarella,2 pieces of basil,4 pieces of pepperoni and about 6 pieces of mushrooms we would have been better off ordering naked pizza with just sauce\\nWe also ordered zepola which was cooked in the same oil as the calamari and tasted like it\\nLastly we got the cannoli which was subpar \\nI hope they were just having an off night but I will think twice beI wanted to ensure we went with a local company for my home warranty and unfortunately we chose this company. \\n\\nThe customer service is horrific they don\\'t care about the customer and Kevin the guy I was working with would not help me with the issue that was covered by the warranty. I kept telling him, it doesn\\'t seem like you want to help me. He said I would have to get him documentation of other services performed by a professional prior to them fixing the issue. The company they used to come to try and fix my dishwasher (that was leaking) was horrible to. Both companies kept blaming each other.  I would have assumed to have it fixed in possibly a week maybe two. It took over 3 months of fighting with them for them to say they weren\\'t going to help. I have been paying two years for the warranty and didn\\'t have one issue.  Bottom line is it still didn\\'t get fixed and they didn\\'t care. I am canceling my policy and going with another company.Purchased a remanufactured battery. Was wrong size for my truck and it fried my starter due to this. Went back to exchange it for correct size and was told you get what you get and that one will work with a charge. I was told to goto another location to exchange it for the correct one. That location sent me to a warehouse where they said no receipt no exchange. I was not given one in first place. Do yourself the favor and spend the extra money at a reputable place with a real warranty and prorated replacement. I will be going to dmv to file a complaint as well as BBB as this experience cost me a days work plus a new starter.I brought my car in on Mon. and didnt get my car back for 3 weeks and there communication ,customer service were lacking to say the least .Replaced part that did not need to be replaced cost me $325.oo. And it broke down on the way home .DONT take your car there . I feel cheated and  any input i had to say was ignored \"maybe \"because i am female .i give them a half star.This is by far the worst experience I\\'ve ever had at a restaurant in this area. The staff was completely unhelpful and clueless. I ordered take out and they forget half the order, so I had to make a second trip to pick up the forgotten chips and guacamole. After my second trip I simply gave up as they still forgot to include the chips. The drink machine was also broken so the beverage I purchased was completely useless. The staff had no interest in repairing the broken machine. Also, while talking on the phone trying to resolve my broken order, the staff was absolutely clueless and seemingly didn\\'t remember the order I had picked up only moments earlier. All of this could be forgiven if the food didn\\'t taste like trash. If you\\'re looking for Mexican in Phoenix, do yourself a favor and go to chipotle....We regularly take our elderly mother who lives in assisted living here for Sunday brunch. However, this Sunday we had a very unpleasant experience. I asked to speak with the manager and the bartender spoke with us. He was extremely rude. We have spent hundreds of dollars in this place over the past five years.  Never again. We went down the street to Luke & Mike\\'s Front Porch, and they were wonderful.This location sucks , waited 7 minutes for the drive thru guy to say one word for me , waited 5 more minutes for him to even take my order . Got to the window , waited 23 minutes for him to open the window and take my payment , waited 12 more minutes for my smoothies to come out , only ordered 3 smoothies & it took 47 minutes !!!! ridiculous , don\\'t ever waste you time & come here . he didn\\'t even apologize for the wait let alone didn\\'t say have a good night either . - erin & maddieCame by for a martini after work could not get a club soda. They don\\'t sell it by the glass. This is my 3 time here. Strike 3.I have eaten middle eastern food all over Toronto. Came here for lunch and ordered a simple Swarma. While waiting out of curiously and was surprised at the low scoring reviews. Then my sandwich arrived and I realized my wife and I had different toppings (but I hadn\\'t order any of my toppings). Not the end of the world and my sandwich was okay. My son didn\\'t like the pickles or beets and picked his out. It is just odd that when u publish toppings on the menu you don\\'t ask what people want. Next time I will go to a smaller family owned shop and make sure I decide what is on my sandwich. Service. Poor overall service unless you are an UBER eats driver as they take care of those guys.Seriously disappointing. I should have just grabbed Chinese food from Panda Express...it would have been better. \\n\\nMy boyfriend had grabbed lunch here and liked their Panag Curry. When he was leaving they told him they\\'d been voted Best in the Valley for Chinese food 3 years in a row, which after trying it I can say is a blatant lie.\\n\\nWe got Mongolian Beef, Sesame Chicken and Beef Chow Mein. The Mongolian Beef was the best of the 3, but was still MEH, at best. The Sesame Chicken was dry and the sauce was not like any sesame chicken sauce I\\'ve ever had, and not in a good way. Also, it came on a bed of shredded lettuce, which was very offputting for me. The Chow Mein was not even chow mein by any definition! On top of that the beef in it was extremely dry and flavorless.  \\n\\nWe LOVE Chinese leftovers, but this was so crummy we threw the leftovers away.I have never been more disappointed by the care I was provided with at MountainView Hospital. I asked to be paired with an OB-GYN that came especially recommended by a friend. Unfortunately that doctor was unavailable so I was paired with Dr. Howard. (I also was put into a residency clinic, which the front desk never informed me of.) I was diagnosed with hyper emesis for the first four months of my pregnancy and had to be hospitalized. During my hospital stay I had an allergic reaction to the medication I was administered. (Medication that contained an active drug that I was allergic to.) \\nThen soon after Dr. Howard left the practice and I was passed around to three different doctors. The experience was horrible and the quality of care is non-existent. This hospital does not care for its patients nor their well-being. It\\'s disheartening that this was the experience I had to go through during my first months of my pregnancy.Dolce is not a sweet dining experience.\\nThe restaurant is crowded with too many tables in the for the square footage..\\nService was slow and inattentive.\\nThe entrée was returned because it was too salty, no alternative was offered. \\nObviously a poorly managed establishment.\\n\\nSave yourself the frustration and visit other Italian restaurants in the area.  Here\\'s a link to the top 10 (notice Dolce is not one of them): http://www.10best.com/destinations/north-carolina/charlotte/restaurants/italian/Worst experience ever. A fairly regular customer that will not be returning ever. If as a company you don\\'t take down people\\'s information and have a policy of stopping people in the middle of ther massages and kicking them out you don\\'t deserve my money. We called and booked came in said we had an appointment then were kicked out and told our appointment was at their other location and we needed to go there. Umm no sorry not ever returningHorribly sticky floors,  reminiscent of walking on fly paper. Bland \"food\",  generic beer selection. I\\'m not returning anytime soon.OK, this is definitely my first review of a gas station, but I thought I would add on to the other negative reviews.\\n\\nI don\\'t know what the story is at this place, but they have an amazingly high traffic, convenient location and they waste it.  Many times, I have pulled in and they have been OUT OF GAS!  It is a gas station, so I think it is pretty important that they keep some gasoline in stock.  Also, if you go inside, they don\\'t really keep anything else in stock either.Good and large choose of features in the shop however I don\\'t recommend the rep department to fix a vintage bike!Terrible experience. Waited almost an hour for mac n cheese and tuna melts that were small and worse than I can make at home. And the bill was almost $50! So much for one $. We will not be back.The long haired dude that served me looked and acted like he wanted to chop me into little pieces with a machete, so I just left. \\nThanks for nothing :)Ace car rental is not inside the airport. Their is a second shuttle which takes you to the car rental site. The shuttle driver said it is a free shuttle yet my on my receipt i noticed that they charged me a shuttle fee. The customer service agent I dealt with told me I had to get the Ace additional insurance cause I didn\\'t have a copy of my full coverage insurance policy. I had rented cars with other companies and never needed a copy of my insurance. She proceeded to inform me that if I didn\\'t opt for Ace\\'s insurance that I would have to continue to pay for the car daily until my insurance company and Ace hashed out any damages. I booked my car through Expedia and Ace\\'s prices were cheaper, but when you factor in the second shuttle and the additional insurance they basically forced me to get, I wish I would have used a more reputable company.I got a letter in the mail saying Campus Pointe is in bankruptcy court. No surprise to me. \\nAlso, my worst fear came true living here. There was a shooting in the courtyard at 3AM and with the paper-thin windows, I was so scared a bullet might fly through into my apartment. I had to hide behind my bed for about 30-45 minutes until I was certain the situation was under control. \\nThe human feces problem is ridiculous. Where is it coming from and why is it even a problem? I was doing laundry one day and someone had pooped in a washer. I have heard that bums are pooping everywhere. Trash is everywhere. People are hanging out in front of my apartment at night, they leave their cigarette butts in front of my apartment, are loud and obnoxious, and I can\\'t sleep anymore. \\nI just overheard my next door neighbor or someone they are acquainted talking about their warrants out for their arrest, their guns, and drugs. That\\'s just amazing. I want out!\\nAbsolutely the worst place to live. I am constantly in fear of my safety and worried that I am going to come home to my apartment being broken into. There are strange people outside at all hours of the night and morning drinking, doing drugs, listening to loud music, and having unnecessarily loud conversations. It seems like once one group of trash is evicted, another group that is even worse replaces it. There are fights all the time, you can never go without seeing a broken window, people walk by and smack windows in the middle of the night, the elevator is always broken, the list goes on. It is just a miserable place. It is disgusting that no matter how clean you keep your apartment and request pest control there are still bugs. It is gross. I understand the complex is old, however the air conditioning went out three times over the summer, the hot water was out for a three days a couple of times; these are basic necessities that should be taken care of right away or at least taken of the rent. It is just ridiculous.\\n\\nDo not sacrifice having the close proximity to campus for your safety. I hate the noise and I hate everything, but no one should have to worry about stray bullets flying through their window, or some crazy weirdo knocking insistently on their door at 3am looking for drugs. Management\\'s advice is to call the police. That is just common sense if someone is getting their face bashed in front of your window. Why don\\'t they just try to keep out the trash before someone is killed? Stay away from this place at all costs. \\n\\nThe air conditioning hasn\\'t been working since the weather has become warmer and when it is 90 degrees outside, it feels better outside than inside my apartment. Management keeps saying it will be fixed, but has it been fixed? NO. They don\\'t respect their tenants rights, nor do they follow Arizona Landlord Tenant Laws. Someone needs to shut this place down.i was going to get a membership since i had one the last time i lived in vegas and it was great (07) however the store has changed so much... everything that i used to like is now gone... \\nthey used to have killer black angus roast beef-gone\\noreida mozzarella sticks-gone\\nbakers and chefs penne and pickles- gone\\nnathans hot dogs- gone\\nnot to mention that all the prices are ridic high compared to say food4less or marianas or cardenas market....\\nmaybe ill check out costco, def not worth it...\\n\\nOOOOO and one other side note.... they sell \"nathans\" hot dogs in there food court but dont have them in the store? and there is nooooooo way in.... that those are nathans hot dogs.... trust me. \\n\\noverall overpriced, not worth it, and crappy.This location is the closest to where I work and is on my way home for my lunch break. Service at this location is extremely slow and placing an online order hardly remedies the situation. Numerous times have I arrived after the scheduled pick up time to find out my order is not ready and will take an additional 10 to 15 minutes. I don\\'t recommend coming here if you\\'re in a rush.Today kind of busy night at gym! Feeling not that satisfied... no paper towel  to clean ur station after workout! Workers noticed that there is no paper towel but the worker not even try to fill the paper towel box. Feeling not that comfortable to workout today coz i dont want bring germs every where...BIZARRE.  Unprofessional.  Revolving door for hair stylists.Very unfriendly customer service. Gum \\nsmacking /popping  girl at the counter has yet to acknowledge my presence. I only come here because of the price and every time i tip, they NEVER say thank you!!! They don\\'t ask what you want and if they screw up they don\\'t apologize (I\\'m a guy and they arched my eyebrows like crazy last time I came in)(using moms yelp to post) This will be the last time I\\'ll ever come as I will be looking for another location , even if I have to pay more. I guess they\\'ll never get the \"Good Customer Service \" concept !! That\\'s what keeps a business successful ... They\\'re not getting a tip this time , it\\'s not like they appreciate it anyway ! Oh wait... The gum smacking girl opened her mouth as I was paying and asked if I wanted to leave a tip!! Uhhhh NO! That shut her back up quick! Don\\'t get me wrong I do tip when it\\'s deserved ...I would love to tell you all about their gelato. However, they really have no order system or any sort of line that you wait in. You are just supposed to rush the counter and I guess it\\'s first come first serve. Worked my way to the front with my 4 year old in tow. I started to place my order once one of the terrified overwhelmed servers attempted to make eye contact. I was interrupted by an impatient woman demanding free samples of the strawberry. This repeated itself 3 more times, as my order was interrupted and not filled...and I finally realized I was wasting my time. My son and I left and walked next door to Cream and were served in half the time with none of the confusion. Note to management: Invest a few bucks in a couple of cones and make a line? Stop wasting everyone\\'s time. You make it impossible for your staff to manage your customers efficiently. I\\'m not interested in getting into a mosh pit or screaming match to order gelato. I do not care how tasty it supposedly is....And BTW, I was trying to place and order that I was actually paying for, only to get over run by people trying to feed their families of 6 entirely with FREE SAMPLES. The best part is, that while waiting in line at your competitor, several people behind me were openly complaining about the same issue I had with this establishment and opted to also take their money elsewhere. Hopefully management learns and makes the necessary changes, otherwise we will not be back.If you like pizza that costs twice as much as it should, but only tastes half as good as it should, then Humble Pie is for you.  I couldn\\'t believe how much I disliked my pepperoni pizza that cost me $16.49. I fully expected that for that much money the pizza would have been a lot better than \"barely passable.\"\\n\\nI should have gone to Pei Wei next door for 60% of the price.I don\\'t care how drunk you are. Avoid this place at all cost. It\\'s gross, and expensive. \\n\\nDon\\'t eat here. Don\\'t eat here. Don\\'t eat here.I rented a car for 3 days ($298.00 midsize vehicleI had to change flight due to mechanical error, airline ask me if I can go on the next flight. I called Advantage and told them that I was keeping the car for an extra day, the representative told it would cost me $194.00, it\\'s in my contact.  They need to change the name \"Taking Advantage\"  I will never rent from themSuper disappointing. Two of my girlfriends and I went here recently for dinner. The decor is amazing. Impeccable. We sat on the patio with the large door open. The entire vibe is perfect. The chairs weren\\'t comfortable but the look was amazing. But that\\'s about where it ends. We all ordered drinks - I didn\\'t love mine at first and our server offered to swap it out. I got a blackberry mixed drink instead. Don\\'t remember the name but it was pretty good. My friend asked about the bread - our server said he\\'d bring them out. So we waited. We ordered. \\n\\nMy friends ordered burgers and mac and cheese. I ordered the meat special - crab cake with the two sides the server recommended, squash casserole and mac and cheese. Our food came out (we had to ask about the bread again and it was brought out with our meal) and it was a major disappointment. Both of my friends ordered their burgers a certain temp (neither of which was well done) and both were served well done. My one friend ordered her burger with no tomato jam but there was tomato jam on it. She bit into it and within minutes had an allergic reaction. They apologized, redid the burgers and comped their meal, so the customer service was good. The second round of burgers had the right ingredients but were still well done. As for my crab cake? Meh. It was kinda wet and soggy inside. I ended up mainly eating the outside of it and leaving the soggy part on the plate. The sides weren\\'t great to me. I only ate a few bites of the mac because I limit dairy. I brought the remainder home to fiance to eat and he described them as \"just okay\". \\n\\nFor the inconvenience of having to redo the meals, they offered us dessert. We shared the oatmeal cookie and hummingbird cake. They were the best part of the meal. \\n\\nOverall - it was a major disappointment. I won\\'t be back.\\n\\nUpdate: a few hours after eating here, I had the worst stomach ache and got sick twice throughout the night. The next morning I see a text from one of my girlfriends who ate with me the night before at Packhouse and she reports the same!ALERT: This place is dirty and they do not sterilize their instruments!  UNSANITARY!This is the worst place I have ever been.  I went with family members today for a pedicure and let me just say it was a disaster from the moment we walked in.  The chairs only move forward and backwards. The nail tech that did my pedicure did not speak one word to me.  She worked really fast even though no one was waiting. She only cut my nails and filed them and did not do my cuticles at all.  She did a super fast moving leg massage for no more than two minutes and then had me dip my feet into a community paraffin container.  Yuck!  Then she peeled off the paraffin and dried my toes and slapped the nail polish on.  After the coat was applied she just put the topcoat on my big toe and then just touched the bush in a single dot on my other toes.  The top coat didn\\'t even cover the polish.  She got up and I looked at my toes and there was polish all over my skin.  I asked her if she could remove the excess polish and she proceeded to actually strip off some of the polish on my toes.  She got the polish back out and touched up several spots she striped off with the brush.  She said thank you and got up and walked away.  I asked her how much that pedicure was and she said 35 dollars. Not only is this the most unprofessional place I have ever \\nbeen to but my pedicure was less than 20 minutes at best.  My family members and I will NEVER return to this dump.  As a final note, my polish has chipped off my toes within 6 hours.  DO NOT GO HERE!Fly Allegiant air \"where the planes never fly on time!\\nThis should be there new mantra.  Allegiant decided to give our plane to another destination.  Thats so nice, no mechanical problems they just needed the plane.  What a way to run an airline.  I opted to save some money and once again i got what i payed for.  A disorganized mess.  Next time ill spend the extra for a ticket on a better more organized airline carrier.  Cheers and  beers! Thankfully their is a nice bar nearby!This review is simply from a customer service point of view. They have certain drinks that come in custom Genghis glasses for customers to bring home. As I was leaving with my glass I was rudely approached by a employee that asked for my glass. I handed to him assuming I was in the wrong and I explained the menu said I could take the glass. He said it costs money and my waitress should have told me that. I leave and begin to realize I could have paid for that glass and he should have asked. Also why was he so rude? I called the restaurant shortly after I left and was told they would let their employees know. No apology or explanation. Simply rude.This location sucks. The 2 females working when I came were so friggin rude wow.. I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever been treated so rude for absolutely no reason. They also took none of my 15 items (all designer names) I found that odd :/ will not be returning. Save your time and Go to another location!!My unpleasant experience occurred a few years ago, and I have not returned. However, I systematically receive texts and phone calls still in an attempt for me to come back for another visit. My annoyance in their persistent attempts to keep me as a patient has prompted me to leave this review.\\n\\nI initially sought their medical advice on a recommendation from a friend. I was unofficially diagnosed by my physician father in law years ago with hypothyroidism years go, but I never made much of an attempt to get an actual diagnosis from a doctor that can treat me without ethical conflict. I was made aware how difficult and time-consuming it can be to get a medical diagnosis for hypothyroidism because your blood work has to be done at just the right time, and you have to have a doctor that really knows what to look for. I didn\\'t want to deal with that so I just kind of went into denial over the whole thing and did nothing.  Over the years my symptoms became more prevalent and stronger in effect on my body. I did hours of my own research and every scientific study I read on thyroid issues and the symptoms thereof were dead on to my own physical issues I had been experiencing for years. I went in and sat down with a physician\\'s assistant who took great care in listening to me. He was wonderful, attentive, and detailed. Blood was taken and a follow-up appointment was set to go over the results. At this time I also set an appointment with the on staff gynecologist at a later date for my yearly exam.\\n\\nA few days before my appointment to come in for the blood test results I received a call requesting that I merge that appointment with that of my lady bits exam. I agreed. The next week I went in and the gynecologist sat me down before my exam to go over the blood test. This was the most insulting experience I ever had with a doctor. She said all my levels were normal except for my liver enzymes. She then said that really that can be caused by only a couple of things. The first option is there is a piece of fat that has attached itself to my liver. If that is the case it will dissolve over time and everything will be fine. The other option is that I drink too much and it\\'s affecting my liver. HUGE RED FLAG!!! I (at the VERY most) have one or two drinks a MONTH!! And I\\'m talking about a glass of red wine. Nothing major. After she made that comment to paused and looked up at me as if waiting for a reaction from me to affirm that diagnosis. She basically called me an alcoholic. The conversation didn\\'t really go on past that, other than her writing a prescription for an antidepression/anti-anxiety medication..... which I dropped in the trash the minute I got home. I will add that when I go home I also looked up causes for elevated liver enzymes. Big surprise, there are countless different medical issues that can cause elevated liver enzymes; not just fat and excessive alcohol. And on that list.... hypothyroidism.\\n\\nAdditionally, while I was having my lady\\'s exam done, her assistant (nurse?) was walking in and out of the room... opening the door rather widely and slowly each time. The angle at which I was laying gave a VERY good view for anyone standing or sitting at the nurse\\'s station right outside the door. \\n\\nI have a medical background. I have also (like most) been on many personal visits to medical offices for various reasons throughout my life. This was the worse experience I have ever been a victim of. This doctor clearly didn\\'t care about my ongoing health. She basically diagnosed me as a depressed alcoholic and offered a band-aid (not a solution) to her diagnosis with the prescription. And then she failed to fail to keep my dignity guarded during what is most arguably the most personal exam a woman can have. I don\\'t know if she is still there. I think her name was Jessica. But that experience will keep me from ever wanting to return.Don\\'t roll in here if you have a Canadian driver\\'s license.  \\n\\nWon\\'t let you in for a drink even if you\\'re 45years old....Was hoping for a nice lunch with my daughter. Not sure what has happened with the service industry. In my option it sucks. You pay $50 for lunch and get shit service. I\\'m better off eating at home. The food was okay. My water, drinks, appetizer, entre show up at the same time. As everything  is being served at once my waiter spills my margarita on my pants and sandal. Says sorry, runs away never to be seen again. Luckily anther server was near by to get a napkin to wipe myself off. Seriously. I complained maybe thinking the manager would come by, but only to hear the server is busy. Never going back, that\\'s for sure. If my waiter was so busy the manager should be helping making sure everything runs smoothly. I\\'m sure the manager was standing there with his thumb up his ass.I came here the other day to have a bite to eat for lunch. When I got there the place seemed decent. After ordering my food I grabbed a seat at a very uncomfortable booth. What I ordered was A carne asada burrito that came with some tortilla chips. Once I was a few bites in I realized the burrito tasted horrible. I continued to eat it because well I payed for it! I got just over half way threw and had to throw it away because I couldn\\'t hack it anymore. \\n\\nI DO NOT recommend this place to anyone.The food is delicious but.....the service is terrible. We had a reservation and still waited 15 minutes for our table. Then it took an hour for chips and guacamole as well as our drinks. Here\\'s the bad part- when we complained we received a very apathetic and unconcerned response. They gave us 50% off but never once apologized. From the hosts to the manager it felt like no one cared if we had a positive experience. For the price and the competition you\\'ve got to do better than that! I won\\'t be backI had out of town guests to the club for a semi quiet night knowing the nature of Scottsdale on a Friday. We decide to go to Dakota for a drink and come home 3 blocks away. We were unable to get in on our first attempt due to dress code requirements. We went home and changed our sandals to meet the requirements and when we came back we were told we could not enter due to not having passports. Craig, the manager asked us to \"convince him\" which I assume meant to give him more money to enter. At that point I told him that the people who work for him are dumbasses for not checking ID and asking for more valid ID. He was asking for two forms of ID from people from the Czech Republic. A passport is valid anywhere in the world which is what was presented at the time and all valid. Craig decided he didn\\'t like me calling his employees dumbasses and pushed me into another lady patron, knocking us both to the floor. Then, my wife decided to stand up for me and tell Craig that he could not push her husband down (embarrassing) and punched her in the face. Not professional or legal I\\'m pretty sure. When I asked him for his name, he would not give his last name as I\\'m sure he did not want to be recognized for what he had done. My wife, who I am so incredibly grateful for, kept me from going back to call the police and/or doing harm to Craig. I hope that anyone deciding to go to Dakota will consider the possibility of a violent and incredibly, unbelievably, horrific night.Not impressed. The coffee is awful! Shouldn\\'t it taste fresh brewed in the early a.m.? For some reason I decided to get a breakfast bagel sandwich which was nothing special. Most importantly though, the service sucked. We were the only ones in line but the girl behind the counter said to us 3 times, I can help you down here when you\\'re ready. Okay, I get it! I don\\'t see what her point was though cause she was rude and pushy when we did finally place an order.I eat out in Vegas about 3 to 4 times a week. First and last time at this restaurant. Food was old, manager very unprofessional, and the prices are ridiculous for what you get. Don\\'t waste your time. I should have known something was wrong when there were only four tables with customers.I used to love this place. It all went down the past few weeks. The food quality was lacking compared to their norm. Usually I could have shrugged this off but this last time was most disappointing. My wife was just cut from a long double. When we walked in I noticed three very young snickering girls at the bar. The bartender approached us and after ordering our drinks he said he couldn\\'t serve my wife because the manager, who was one of the snickering girls, believed she was intoxicated, which was quite the opposite. The girls sitting around the bar continued to laugh. Obviously we were way more aware than they realized. Normally they have decent bar food and good drink specials but if this how they treat customers they don\\'t deserve business. The biggest complaint is their beer lines taste dirty. The biggest plus used to be fried pickles but now I just enjoy them at The Turf instead. Usually I\\'m not so easily offended but this was bit ridiculous. I will definitely update my review if this changes.Always closing early and never got to try them yet. Today arrived at 7:41 and female employee turned the sign to close and locked front door. I had just turned my car off and was annoyed. Owner needs to know his staff are closing earlier than 8pm posted closing time-cardinal sin in food businessThis is my second time at this Avis. Again not to please. Their customer service is terrible. The lady let the line get out of hand before informing us that she is working on another customer paperwork who was not present. This place needs to management as the manager did not step in when seeing the line overly long.Wow Hadi, not much has changed since I worked for you. Still screwing your customers!! If you want to see how a real moving company works hit me up and I\\'ll let you see how I run my buisness.I wish I could give this place a half of a star or zero stars.   I live in Las Vegas and have been here a couple of times.  The first time I was excited because I like watching Guy on DDD and I know he KNOWS what people love but, I could not have been more disappointed!  The food is totally overpriced and the selection not that great.  We got an appetizer of pretzel sticks wrapped in pepperoni with a cheese dip - this was a joke, it was pretzel rods - the kind you buy in a bag at the store.  This was something like $15.00.  The rest of the food that was ordered SUCKED.  Everyone ordered different things so we could all try everything and NOTHING was good.  The next time I went was with a different group of friends that were in town and wanted to try it so...i went.  I  was hoping for a better experience, but once again, TOTALLY disappointed.  \\nFor all of the food this Guy has eaten, this is a huge disappointment.  Overpriced and overhyped.  I\\'ve had better food from a hot dog stand outside of a Home Depot!It appears that this location has trouble counting. We ordered to go, and my order was one wing short, my wife\\'s was two....and we paid for extra sauce that we didn\\'t get. I don\\'t ask for much from hooters....just that I receive all the food I pay for.This is not Asian food at all. This is like a weird combination of like American hipster with some Asian sauces. Just no. If you like this then that\\'s fine but this is not Asian food. Overpriced.Food was good for the price but they did not take Steak n\\' Shake gift cards.  I find it absolutely ridiculous that they do not even take their own gift cards.  Where else am I supposed to use a Steak n\\' Shake gift card?!!!!!WARNING!!!!! DO NOT BUY HERE!!!!\\n\\nThese people are scam artist. They will rip you off. We have been waiting for two months for our car title and nothing. The DMV has not received it and Auto Planet and it\\'s owner say the DMV Is lying. The owner is a liar and is rude. He yelled at my pregnant wife.Yeah, I cant even properly review this place because we were actually just shunned. My mom and I were at the counter waiting to order, and the man at the counter basically tottered around ignoring us. Then, when a family came in behind us, he proceeded to look right past us and serve them. We looked at each other and confused, watched as he immediately rang throigh and processed their order while continuing to kot acknowledge us standing at th counter. I am blown away and confused. My mom and I were completely ignored and didnt even get the opportunity to try the food. Great customer service....This place is the worst customer service check out ever! It is  12:00pm Sunday and you only have two people ringing? Ok I\\'ll give you maybe people call in sick. Me and 20 other people are in line waiting. Then your manager on duty is laughing and joking with another associate, as she gives her change. Noticing the line is getting longer you take your time laugh some more. With no one being helped nor being rung up. We are all still standing in line? Then after something is said both of you start to ring up again. With the manager still laughing. So sorry. I have been in retail for a long time totally unacceptable. I left my basket and the 300.00 worth of stuff I was going to buy there. The only good thing is the security officer, she welcomes you as you come in.This company is the worst. Their employees are disrespectful and the work is way below par. Do yourself a favor and find someone else even if it costs a bit more.THRID break in this year. Two in just this semester. The edge has done NOTHING to ensure my safety or resolve the problem. I feel so unsafe I do not even go there and are stuck in my lease. Last night GUNSHOTS fired right outside my door, again they have done nothing about it and do not plan to..So glad this place has closed...the owner was terrible...a bunch of  friends went there for a birthday celebration and the owner was soooo rude...very embarrassing situation for all my friends....I went to every social media outlet to warn people about the establishmentI wasn\\'t impressed with the food at all.  It was below average.  I feel IHOP is the same or better.  Server didn\\'t seem to interested in helping us or answering any questions we had.  I will not recommended this place or come back here again.  I\\'m surprised that the reviews are this high.  Maybe today was one of their off days.Had the opportunity to go into Shoe Bag Today, greeted by staff and then came RUDE interjection by the \"Owner\".\\n\\nBuyer Beware!!Plan to wait, they never see you on time, and im talking 2 hours.  They are rushed, failed to read my records, saw \\nan irregular heartbeat and ordered expensive nuclear test.  On follow up i pointed out i was on digoxin...... The cause of the irregular heartbeat.  If you complain they send a letter saying they will no longer see youMy husband love the tacos ... but I go menudo \"to go\" of course I took it home. Turns out it have a little meat and like 1/4 cup of corn. I feel like I got cheated... I always recommend this place to everyone but now I won\\'t.Roach by the kitchen door... Considering floor was filthy, makes sense roaches a hanging out. Must note,: roach was on the back squirming around like it was dying and after the staff was notified, they came and swept it up.Sunday morning without a reservation is a 4 hour wait. Not recommended. One person called every hour to fill spots vacated by no shows.I have now been to galaxy nails twice. The first time I received a pedicure and was pleased with their service so decided to go back for the new SNS manicure I had heard about. My friend came with me. We both were getting the SNS (it\\'s like gel but with power like acrylic but supposed to be better for your nails). As they started I noticed the lady next to me started doing a base coat on my friends nails, my lady did not do that, so I asked and she said oh no I did then began putting the base on others. Then the other lady was using a light and mine did not. I had noticed that the powder was making the look bumpy so asked about it she said it gets filed out. At the end of the process the thumb nail was still bumpy, they were not drying fast like gel and had to air dry and they did not have a polished finish like the pictures. I voiced my concerns and they said they could take them off for me. After that process they proceeded to charge me for a manicure which states it included cuticle massage etc. which I did not receive. My friend was also not happy with hers so they put a top gel over it which made it look a little shiner but texture was still off. I wish the customer service would have been better if I leave your salon with nothing on my nails and still have to pay after not liking the services it\\'s rather disappointing.Very disappointed of this place I won\\'t recommend any more, last time we were there they took forever to give the check, they got busy and didn\\'t know what to do, we order some to go and they forget about it, we notified the owner and he didn\\'t even apologized to us instead he charged us what we order to go without even giving us tbe food. VERY bad service, my family always wanted to come with us but I will never take them to this place.These guys SUCK!!! Please people take your business elsewhere....I started a claim almost 3 months ago and sure as shit they responded the same day as soon as they got their $$$ deduct..since then \\nIt\\'s been a lot of NON-Comunication on their part with me sending email after email and phone calls that no one ever responds too!!\\nFinally left a complaint with the BBB and wouldn\\'t you know I received an email saying it was in process with the underwriters...oh and that they sent me 2 letters asking for more info..\"which I never got\" btw.....super fricken frustrated, and too boot I\\'m paying for a line I can\\'t ducking USE!!!! Ugh never again!! #%^*+*^%% this companyPartell Specialty Pharmacy is the worse pharmacy in the world - they should be closed down. I have been trying since December to get my Rx filled, even with the Dr\\'s office calling and faxing them they CANNOT get it correct; 5 trips I\\'ve made over the last 3 months! I went in today, after confirming by phone with the pharmacist yesterday, that it\\'s correct and ready for pickup & they look at me like they don\\'t understand why I came in . . . since they have nothing ready for me. Then when the woman at the counter went in back to have the compound filled she comes back with a jar dated 2/4/2013 that is scheduled to expire on 3/4 and tells me I should have come in on time to pick it up - I almost screamed: I was there in December, again in January, then on Feb 4th & again on Feb 14th because they kept saying my Doctor wanted me to have pills instead of a compound - except they were incorrect, they wouldn\\'t believe me, the dr\\'s office or even the empty jar I brought in that had been previously filled FROM THEIR PHARMACY. I finally got them to fill it (but I think they just changed the label to show a different date. when I asked \"how can I prevent this from happening again?\" she looked at me with a straight face & said \"next time come in on time to pick up your prescription\".  THEY SHOULD BE INVESTIGATEDCame here for lunch after shopping. I will never ever go to another T.G.I.Fridays. My server Marissa or Miranda would not serve me. The host Trent from the front that seated me had to serve me. I\\'m  sure this had to do with the color of my skin. To my put one star cause I needed it for this review. I guess I have to find another favorite restaurant.Poor service. After waiting for nearly 45 minutes, and making it very clear that I am HIGHLY allergic to sesame seeds, I received one of the dishes in my order made with sesame seeds. Needless to say.. it was taken back and remade, however staff should be more attentive, and quick.Tried to shop here today. Couldn\\'t find what I was looking for and couldn\\'t find some one to help me. When I tried to check out they had one till open and an insane line. Won\\'t be coming back this is pretty standard procedure for this placeI called the \"Hotel Doctor\" last night. Told him my issue and he asked me to hold on. After about 10 minutes of having me on hold he must have decided my cash wasn\\'t as green as someone else\\'s because I was hung up on.  The ER happily took my money and helped me out. The hotel doctor is a joke that just wants to overcharge desperate tourists. What a horrible way to run a business!Sadly, I\\'m not going to review on the sushi..... My wife and I were craving sushi and decided to try The Sushi. As we walked in, there were customers at the sushi bar and a few at tables. Not extremely busy. We waited what seemed liked forever to be seated. We weren\\'t asked about drinks and no water was ever brought to us. We literally sat there 10 minutes wondering if we would get some service. A few minutes later we decided to go elsewhere because we felt completely ignored. Had hi hopes for a non AYCE sushi house.Yuck!! We ordered delivery a week ago! I really wanted this place to be my new fried chicken place since it\\'s in the neighbourhood, but all I got was gravy that was thinner than soup, chicken that had no flavour other than salt, and lots of salt! And the Mac salad wasn\\'t even homemade! Take  out menu was put in garbage so I can forget this whole ordeal!**UPDATE**\\nWashers and dryers still don\\'t work. This is not the first time our clothes have came out soaking wet. There was still a pool of water in the washer. The dryers don\\'t dry either so we just wasted money once again. This is a problem they said they \"would fix\". Was told to just \"go the the laundry mat down he street\" no thank you, I would like to do laundry at my apartment that I pay for because it is inconvenient to have to drive somewhere else to do laundry. \\n\\nI really hate complaining and leaving a bad review but I really want to save someone the trouble of moving here. \\n\\nWe have lived here since August and the water has been shut off at least 3-4 times a month. Now we\\'ve been without hot water since Wednesday and I was told it won\\'t be on for at least a week.  The apartments next to us were completely flooded with water and people had stuff ruined. There has been no apologies or any sort of compensation besides a \"sorry for the inconvenience\" email. It states in the lease agreement that it is their responsibility to provide hot running water at all times and they fail to do so. I understand that this was completely out of their control, but maybe this apartment shouldn\\'t be in business if water can\\'t be provided at all times. Or at least they shouldn\\'t put it in the lease agreement. Like I said, out of their control but they aren\\'t even trying to make this situation easier for us. \\n\\nNot to mention that it is disgusting here. There is dog poop everywhere. I can\\'t even take my dog to the dog park without having to pick up other peopldog\\'s poop. And the hot tubs aren\\'t even warm. We have also had more problems that I don\\'t need to go into on here, but you can message me for questions. \\n\\nIf you enjoy taking hot showers in your apartment and don\\'t want to shower at your gym, please do not move here.Been here before, and the food wasn\\'t bad til today. My chicken fried steak was burnt, and so was my sisters. What topped it off today was my brother found an ant in his potatoes. We told a waitress name Bridget (wasn\\'t our waitress but she was the first one we saw), and this is what she had to say, \"Unfortunately there is so many bugs in this world, and one happen to land in your potatoes.\" It was an ant, not a bug that \"landed\" in his potatoes. We weren\\'t expecting that type of response. Anyway, needless to say we won\\'t be back. The food today was burnt, and had a bug in it. The service today by Linda was good. She was nice, and very apologetic.  Bridget, and the girl the brought out the food on the other hand may need a little more training on customer service.OMG - they just drop it off in the middle of a two-car driveway and run away (it\\'s 7 ft wide).  No calls, no knock on the door.  I thought they were a no show until I went outside just now.  Cannot reach their local office either.  All numbers go to Florida (and they have about 3 different ones).  AND with IRMA/State of Emergency I am s#!^ out of luck. I will upgrade this to 3 stars if I can get them to come back and move the POD over or take it away.Wow, have to \"go in\" before they will even tell you how much membership is. GHETTO! Facility is old and kind of run-down. Staff is what you would encounter at a typical fast food establishment. Odd smell and in a sketchy part of town = NO THANKS!Summer is the worst server in the world. Could not be bother doing her job. I could have gotten better service at McD\\'sUnrecommended.\\n\\nThe food was mediocre at best.  However, the service here was absolutely crap.\\n\\nI ordered steak and eggs which they managed to screw up.  VERY RARE steak and egg whites only.  Nope.  These fools gave me a well done steak and scrambled the eggs.  They didn\\'t charge me for only asking for egg whites so it\\'s whatever.  I purposely waited until the check came before I ate my eggs so that in the event they did charge me extra, I can prove they did not give me what I had asked for.  I couldn\\'t ask server Kayla because she disappeared off the face if the earth after she took our orders.\\n\\nThe service was atrocious, at least from our server Kayla.  All she did was take our order.  Someone else brought out the food.  She never came back to ask how everything was.  She never came back to refill anything.    If fact, she didn\\'t do jack sht.  The next time we saw her was when she came back to drop off the check without a peep.  Not even, \"Can I get you anything else?\"\\n\\nShe comes back to get the check after I had signed for it and has the audacity to just stand there awkwardly at our table and stare at it... As if she\\'s getting more than what she truly deserves!  Oh wait, she already did!\\n\\nFor a food network star restaurant, food is probably a 2 or 3 (not horrible, but still disappointing) but service from this chick... 0.  She\\'s lucky she got anything out of us.  I should have played the stupid foreign tourist card and left zilch $ for zilch effort.  There\\'s a math wiz.AVOID. For some reason, everytime I eat here I always get sick. The place is not exactly clean. The kitchen looks disgusting. This is perhaps the worst Denny\\'s restaurant in existence. We regularly stop in, not by choice but due to a family member\\'s preference for this horrible, horrible restaurant.  Well... the food quality is adequate, but smaller than usual portions... and the service is nonexistent. For example:  It\\'s 5 p.m. and there are two employees on duty and that includes the cook. It will take 20 or 30 minutes simply to get a glass of water. 30-45 for appetizers. 2-3 hours for the full meal (not including the time it takes to eat it.)  If you want to eat something, plan on waiting. To be clear, this is not a fault of the waitresses, this is a chronic management problem.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this place. Go to the Village Inn, go to McDonald\\'s, go anywhere else but here. The only reason why this Denny\\'s is still in business is because seniors obviously have extremely low standards and cannot perceive the passage of time. It shouldn\\'t take 3 hours to have a freaking meal unless it\\'s Thanksgiving.  The management and staff who work at this restaurant at absolutely no pride in themselves whatsoever.  They\\'re only there to pick up a paycheck, work as less as possible, and leave. Denny\\'s Corporation is a joke. Luckily, for the managers, the senior citizens who frequent this restaurant are extremely apathetic and don\\'t complain. That\\'s the only reasonable explanation why this restaurant is still in business.HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE! I was visiting and i came to get 1 nail fixed it took almost 2 hrs and i had to change nail techs first of all the first person who did my nails shouldn\\'t be doing nails at all her drill was jumping she didn\\'t let let the acrylic harden before filing it it was all flimsy and soft she didn\\'t know how to even paint my nails it was a mess there was gel polish and crylic all under my nail and all on the side of my one nail the tech that fixed my nail did better but it still wasn\\'t right it was a horrible mess and absolute bad first impression i left super upset I wanted to cry like i was really really mad and i still had to pay like what??!!? No way! Never again!Ordered trough uber eats it took longer than expected for the food to be delivered..\\nspicy paneer taco looked yuck taste and presentation wise..\\ntamato soup was red colour water.. \\nhot n sour soup was like uncooked soya sauce..\\nChilli garlic noodles was tasteless and oily..\\n\\nBag say u will find your lost appetite in the bag infact i lost appetite after eating this.. spoiled my weekend mood.. not coming back to this place.This was my first time here, and I\\'m sure it will be my last. It was unusually cold out for Phoenix, so I thought a hot cocoa would be perfect. I ordered a large hot cocoa, not sure what I got but it was the worst hot cocoa I\\'ve had in my life. If pressed, I would have to say it resembles malt ovaltine. ( But with no taste, really bland, Ovaltine would be exciting in comparison. )This has to be one of the worst body repair shops ever!!! I have Geico for insurance and they recommended this repair shop to me. Worst mistake ever!!!! It seems as if nobody does their job at this place. A lady named Shanda was my auto adjuster, she quoted my car to be fixed in 3 days, as it was a few very minor scratches on the passenger door. I put my car in the shop Tuesday, Shanda saying she would have it out by Friday no later! Well, Friday turned into Saturday turned into Monday. Here we are a whole WEEK later...still NOT ready. This company is the worst, you almost have to harass them with phone calls to get ahold of anybody. Shanda doesn\\'t bother to return calls or give you status updates as promised. She will truly just give you the run around. She\\'s rude and extremely unprofessional as I was hung up on. I called this morning to see what time today it would be ready as I had an automated text that the vehicle was done, I was told 10 a.m. later being 2 in the afternoon and was told there are no promises for it to be done today that they still have to assemble the car?!! ...Long story short I was finally able to pick up my car and Shanon pulls up super fast throws it in park, leaves the door open with the key in ignition and says \"here u go!\" And leaves. The car was filthy when I got in, tons of buffering dust all over the seats, and interior. I then went in to proceed with the manager Mrs.Fox, who was very nice. All together, PLEASE do yourselves a favor and take your business elsewhere! This company is nothing but a headache and frustration.this company is a scam and probably paid google to take down my review since they are a paid ad. they pay google to market. they are definitely guilty of grand theft and i have left several reviews on here with google as will as rip off report as well as the bbb. the bbb said they have an a rating only because they are accredited to respond to complains it doesn\\'t mean they will solve them if they steal your money. there data is horrible they are not even targeted data. i paid 1709 dollars to get leads and all i got was an apology how they are not guaranteed data and their marketing guy messed up. i paid for mailers. i asked them to redo my mailers they gave me back 10 unqualified love transfers. that\\'s like ordering a burger getting back a fish sandwich. do not do business with this company unless you have money to throw away. raymond doesn\\'t care once you sign that ach form.Mother of god this establishment is KING OF SPAM. I live in Washington State. I inquire about one vehicle. I call them and ask for a few details, and upon receiving details, I tell them I am not interested.\\n\\nFor the next two weeks I get over 15 phone calls (more than once a day sometimes). I ignore over half of these and several I actually answer and TELL THEM that I am not interested. Literally I have told them 4-5 times that I bought another car somewhere else and don\\'t need them anymore. Yet the next day, I get another call from some \"Eduardo\" asking me the same BS (\"are you still interested?\"). The thing that sent me off is that after these 2 weeks they have now started emailing me about some garbage sale they are having.\\n\\nHow any business thinks that calling someone once a day and emailing them constantly will attract their business is insane. I was fine with their service when I asked for it, but after 2 weeks of \"harassment\" I can do nothing but try to steer all away from dealing with Newport Motors. If you HAVE to deal with them, use a fake contact name & number because even if you tell them you don\\'t want their help, they will not listen.They advertised a cheap daily rate on a mustang so I rented it. I needed to keep the car 2 extra days. Everytime I call their automated system I get a \"system error cannot complete\". My contract said extra days were charged the same as my daily rate so no biggie. Until I get to the airport and return the car. My $113 rental ballooned to $300. There were so many fees and charges I couldnt understnad any of it, including a $30/day late fee (which is no where on my contract). And btw they still use 1980s dot matrix printers.Pretty awful. Crap service, server didn\\'t bother to ask if we needed separate checks- we have him 2 cards assuming he\\'d split up our  bill based on what we ordered. Slow service, especially for how slow restaurant was and for what we ordered. Food wasn\\'t great either. Had hummus trio. Hummus was fine but toast points I was give were stale. It was pretty gross. \\n\\nI would pass on this place, better places in the same area.Horrible! Bought a replacement laptop cord for 50 bucks way overpriced (according to amazon) and it stopped working after 2 months of use. When I brought it in, it took them 5 minutes before they realized they had a customer (could hear 3 men laughing about something in the back). Then they told me my laptop cord had been dropped although the cord has not left it\\'s place on my carpeted floor. Very disappointed in the service I received and the price I paid. I would give 0 stars but yelp won\\'t let me.CLOSED. Went yesterday to use my groupon and there was a for sale sign in the window. There was another sign saying an Italian restaurant is coming soon.Wow, what an awful experience I endured this evening! Tonight, just like every other Friday night, I met with my teammates at your location in Mesa before our softball game for Happy Hour. We all ordered our food and drinks from that menu uneventfully. Our orders took longer than usual to come out, but I attributed that to it being Friday. When the check was eventually presented to us, my girlfriend noticed that everything on the bill was being charged at full price, not the prices from the Happy Hour menu that we ordered from. When we brought this to Shannon (our waitress)\\'s attention, she talked to her manager and then said that she needed to take back 2 of my girlfriend\\'s sliders (half of her food), because \"the happy hour sliders come with 2, and 4 come with the standard menu\", so we could only have 2. To actually TAKE FOOD BACK FROM A PAYING CUSTOMER\\'S PLATE took an incredible lack of judgement. Of course, we asked to speak with a manager, and when Sherri (who claimed to be a manager) came over to our table, she incredulously repeated the same line about the different menus, etc...saying that they were following their \"policy\"  when taking the food back. No one at your establishment demonstrated the smallest bit of customer service or basic tactfulness when dealing with us. Eventually, the manager came back with the 2 infamous sliders in a box, saying that we could take them with us. Obviously, at this point, it is not about the food. It was never about the food! Our experience was embarrassing, humiliating, and infuriating. I will tell everyone I know about the poor customer service my group received, and I am sure, as you can tell by now, my group will never be back to your restaurant. We will take all of our business elsewhere. You can thank Shannon for not understanding how to take an order and Sherri\\'s lack of basic customer service for that.Wow this food is terrible. Came here with the family and everyrhing we ordered was terrible. The steak fajita was undercooked, my daughter\\'s fries were old and stale and when i was looking at the salads on the menu it didnt say that it came with onions and when it came it had onions in it and im allergeic. Terrible placeI have to echo similar sentiments to other posters about the noise level in this library.  DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A QUIET PLACE TO STUDY OR READ.  I\\'m in my mid-twenties as well and have a small child.  So I would say I\\'m not that out of touch with society, people\\'s needs in a library, etc. It\\'s not just how rude most patrons are about talking loudly, or the staff\\'s disinterest in reminding people to \"talk in your inside voice\" (Remember hearing that phrase as kids? I still teach my kid that concept.)  But it\\'s the multiple tutoring sessions with children taking place all over the library...at full volume...and right on top of one another.  I\\'m a student myself and am trying to study as well, but it\\'s extremely difficult to do when you are also hearing math lessons on measurements, grammar lessons on prepositions, and conversations about a kid swallowing a quarter all going on around you.  Right out in the open.  It\\'s rude and inconsiderate of people to host lessons in out there like that.  They should be held in a conference room in the library, at the child\\'s school, or heck even a fast food restaurant where wifi is free and noise and conversation is acceptable to be had there.  I don\\'t understand why the staff allows these tutoring lessons to take place all over the library.  It completely undermines the purpose of the library.I wish I could give -5 stars.  I waited an hour and 45 mins to see the doc, Germaine. He did not say anything about keeping me waiting so long, obviously his time is more important than mine.  He came in with an entourage of med students and did not even ask me if it was ok for them to be present.  I had an  EEG done for epilepsy, when I asked him if should stay on my current meds he told me that was up to my discretion!!  WTF??  He asked me what I do for a living, I told him collision repair and he actually rolled his eyes!!  He just reads test results to you, refuses to explain the medical jargon into plain English.  He talks in circles and never explains your condition, or lack off.  In his best Boris Karloff voice he kept addressing me as \"my friend\", he was not trying to be friendly, he was being condescending.   I asked him to please address me as Ms. Jones, and he kept saying, \"my friend\".  I finally had enough and told him exactly what I thought of him. Horrid bedside manner, condescending, nasty, disrespectful, etc, etc.  I told the students that the best thing they could learn from him was how to NOT treat patients.  I was yelling at him, and guess what!, he has a BOUNCER!!!  Really, no kidding!  I was so furious!  I have never been to a doctors office that actually had a freaking bouncer.  I guess I am not the first person to lose my temper in the office.  Run from this office!  Go to the Ruvo Cleveland Clinic, where you are treated with respect and dignity.  Volunteers actually escort you to your doctors office, and give you a nice flower as you leave.  \\nDr Germaine is a very very nasty man who acts like he is doing you a favor to allow you to be in his presence.  Never again.They may be good but they don\\'t return phone calls. Been trying a few days and the same person says they will call back. So much empty promises. If you run a business please learn to return phone calls otherwise don\\'t bother.I always come to liberty noodle, all the way from Vaughan to eaton centre to eat the best beef pho. Today I order the same thing for me and my mom and we find our soup all red, dark and cloudy . \\nI\\'ve been having the same dish from that same place for months and it\\'s always a clear beef broth. And that\\'s even what the picture shows on the menu. Nothing should be different about it. Even the meat was very dry, overcooked dry. When I went back to ask the girl at the cashier and the one who prepared it, they were very rude and they just said beef pho is always like that! \\nI\\'ve never had a beef pho that bad.\\nI\\'m disappointed in the quality of food as well as the service. Employees are rude$79 dollars for a air filter and regular oil. Keep taking advantage of wives, I bet you feel like men.I came in New Years and it was a ok place to eat , the girl who sat us didn\\'t seem happy at all , I\\'m sure her name was Ashely. The food was also ok could have been better . I was very sad about this place. Was hoping for better service , the bussers were very goodI\\'ve been coming here for a couple years now and the food is really good.The staff is friendly very friendly(thank you guys!) But let me tell you about this \"manager\" jerry. He is a joke!!!, very rude and inconsiderate. This \"man\" has no respect or manners for his guests, honestly I will not be returning here if this p.o.s is still working here. Anna is amazing .. She should be running this show :)...Wow.\\nAfter being gone over a year I get a call for my appointment next week. Huh? I call the office, wait for 5 minutes on hold, hang up and push the billing button, someone picks up immediately (I guessed billing would answer at this office). The lady in billing was VERY nice I must say and apologized, she said the office schedules a physical every year in advanced for you, how kind. What a great way to make money - my wife got the same call and hasn\\'t been a patient for longer than I. So had we not called to cancel, an appointment we never made we would have been charged a no show fee as indicated in the email I also received today. This is a deceptive practice - I sure hope people stop going there and whoever is running this place reconsiders their money making schemes.Service here has changed, the past two times I\\'ve been its been a bad experience sad to say. \\n\\nToday they charged me 3.90 for a tea? What ??? Crazy expensive !\\n\\nThey also cleared my table away as soon as I had the last bite, then handed me the check we were there for less than thirty minutes. Normally I wouldn\\'t mind but my husband and I were having a date night and I felt very uncomfortable like we couldn\\'t linger and talk. Also my roll was tiny and had very little fish.\\n\\nLast time I came I asked for a cucumber wrapped roll and they charged me an additional 3 dollars. \\n\\nI\\'m irritated we won\\'t be backRip off! if you think these girls are real, get a grip. I paid $95 for 100 \"virtual\" addresses only to find no such addresses existed. If you want to waste your money paying for translations to and from supposed babes who say they want to meet you, you are nuts.Looking at other reviews, it looks like this Nathan\\'s is unique in its grossness.\\n\\nWe went there for breakfast on our last day in Vegas as we didn\\'t want to spend time going to another hotel.  The line at McDonald\\'s was long and there was nobody at Nathan\\'s.  Now I know why.\\n\\nThe express breakfast (which is the only breakfast option) is $8 or $9.  The food was horrible and greasy.  My wife was literally gagging trying to choke down her food and ended up just eating the soft, moist toast.  I\\'m a bigger eater than her, and even I was having trouble.  Just disgusting.\\n\\nThe food on my plane ride here was much better.  If  you\\'re trying to decide between the two, go for McDonald\\'s.Been at the Er for over 45 min and have sat in 2 waiting rooms. I am in severe pain due to a severe cut on my hand and I am just on a list and do not know when I will be seen. I am just sitting here crying with my whole arm in pain and it bleeding and numbness is all present. I am trying to be patient and have been to the nurses station after 40 min and no help is in site. I am stuck here as if I were to go to another er I would have to wait all over again.I was a patient of Dr. Lind.   I was prescribed a medication that needed to be specially made and sent to me and after a week I hadn\\'t received and called and found they never ordered it.  Looked past that and this week had terrible pain in my foot. I called on Monday morning and again Tuesday and didn\\'t receive a call until Wednesday, which I missed but called back later.  Never heard from them again.  The Park Road office has terrible management and are very unprofessional.  Since I couldn\\'t reach Carmel Foot Specialists and they do not return calls in a remotely timely manner I went in to get my records.  I was very unhappy with them and the office manager was extremely unprofessional including a parting comment of \\'Have a Nice Day\\' meant to be sarcastic.  I advise getting to a podiatrist who has his office managed well.  I have never been treated so badly by a physicians office.  I clearly got the message that patients come and go and none of them are important.  \\nThey will not be there if you need them ,  I highly suggest you find another practice.This place is a COMPLETE PRICE GOUGING RIP OFF!   I had a mere sliver under my fingernail to deep to remove myself..... and I am fully covered with insurance.... \\n1st the Urgent Care Center and Doctor billed separate.   \\nThe Urgent care bill was $578 -- for admitting me to a room, my portion $268 \\nToday I received an entirely NEW separate bill for the doctor...$223 for his services of removing a sliver from under my fingernail.   NEVER EVER EVER EVER AGAIN would I use this service and feel I have to WARN others, had I read this review I WOULD RUN FAR AWAY .... they have limited capability to deal with anything serious outside of the flu or minor injury, I asked they will only transport you to a hospital\\n\\n2nd my experience of  $891 billed $491 out of pocket for a sliver under my fingernail, which they charged in total  PRICE GOUGE YOU TO DEATH.....$891 for a less than one hour sliver under the fingernail............. used a very basic medical kit, saw the doctor a whole 10 minutes..... this rate prices of this place are BEYOND OUTRAGEOUS!!!This restaurant definitely does not live up to standards... I don\\'t know if Bob Taylor is still around but if not I can only assume he is rolling in his grave. They need to lower their prices by a long shot. The environment felt crowded and like we were all sitting on top of each other. The waitress we had was more of a Tuesday brunch waitress and definitely not a Friday night. She was slow and didn\\'t take very good care of my wife and I and it didn\\'t really seem like she had very many tables to account for it. The food we were served didn\\'t have much flavor and was not worth the money we had to pay for it.. I couldn\\'t even eat a good 40% of my baked potato because it was so burnt. And if you like a little bit of salad with a bowl of ranch you won\\'t be disappointed. My NY strip was cooked correctly but still wasn\\'t very good... it lacked flavor and I couldn\\'t even eat close to 4oz of my 12 oz steak due to the quality of the meat itself. My wife ordered the chicken cordon bleu and ended up not eating a quarter of it. It seemed as though they forgot it was in the fryer for a good 3 minutes past done and decided to serve it anyway. To put it simply the food lacked flavor and definitely quality and at the prices they should definitely have better quality waitstaff and food. I will not visit this establishment again unless they start selling the steak for about $6 a plate... The atmosphere didn\\'t scream $30+ a plate cuisine either.Ordered Teriyaki Chicken and was told it would be a 10 minute wait (which is ridiculous for \"fast\" food). I would\\'ve declined it, but we came to Panda specifically for that dish. So we said we\\'d wait. My husbands food sat out, getting cold, while we waited closer to  15 minutes. In the meantime the one person in the kitchen was openly just standing there on their phone.  It was infuriating to know we were waiting for food while someone was just standing there playing on their phone.  Super unprofessional.Brick and mortar location - smelled musty / moldy. Not even a hint of fresh baked pie or coffee smell. 2 business in same building on each side of this shop did NOT smell musty\\n\\nTried: chocolate peanut, lemon meringue, coconut cream, banana cream\\n\\nCrust = has some layers but no flavor, some pieces had soggy crust\\n\\nWhipped cream on pies = bland, one piece even tasted as if the cream may have been sour\\n\\nCream fillings - dense to the point that it may have been drying out with little flavor\\n\\nLemon custard - sweet, lightly tangy, average\\n\\nMeringue- KUDOS, meringue texture, taste and look was awesome\\n\\nSaw the savory pies but didn\\'t try any. Looked small for $7.95. Cornish Pasty is a much better value for an entree pieWe went here with the intention of buying a new van. Point blank - The dealership was a zoo. Test drove a van but then hubby started to consider an Accord. The Sales Manager went from being our best friend to just walking away from us when the potential sale $$\\'s dropped. \\n\\nThe salesman proceeded to tell us his opinion of our other car (VW Jetta) and he was extremely unprofessional. \\n\\nWe were 18 year customers of Trickett Honda in Nashville TN and only drove Hondas for many, many years. This dealership is an embarrassment to the Honda brand.My dog Ziggy has been there several times with no issue.  The worse thing that happened was that he would hit the lock on his pen that it rubbed a spot on his nose.  This time he got his paw stuck on a chain link fence that was near his pen.  It drew blood.  We were out of town but I had a local friend who should have been contacted.  I found out the next day that this happened.  What they did was to keep him isolated from other dogs in the same pen where he got injured!  I had my friend pick him up and take him to another friend who could watch him.  Also when she came, they did not check her ID!  She had to tell them to do that!   The only way to get him out was for me to pay $120 (he was there since Wednesday).  That also did not make any sense since I had paid a $40 deposit.  \\n\\nFortunately all is good now but I will never send Ziggy back there again.DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT RENT FROM PAYLESS\\n\\nThey lure you in with their low prices, but if you read the fine print carefully they end up charging you an extra few hundred bucks when it\\'s all said and done. \\n\\nInvoiced 300 for the car ended up being close to 600. DONT TRUST THIS COMPANY.I\\'m from out of town and decided to get gas because I\\'m staying down the street and really needed gas. Well little did I know that they sell racing gas! (Who needs racing gas?! Never heard of it in California). Most pumps had \"no service\" bags over most of the damn pumps so I was pretty much left with whatever was available so I chose the stupid pump that offers \"racing fuel\" and didn\\'t F**king realize that I was being charged 8.249 per gallon for it until I looked up at the damn sell point when it reached $88 that I stopped pumping. I was floored, unfortunately they couldn\\'t do anything about the sale since it was already in my damn car. I\\'m so livid right now and can\\'t even think straight. I mean how am I suppose to know to go the the other f**king side where they have regular gas at $2.something a gallon. If you\\'re from out of town go to a more reliable place like chevron or shell so you aren\\'t surprised by the craziness of strange gas places! Save your money and go elsewhere.I was incorrectly billed $11.52 for fuel charges.  When I called to dispute the error, I spoke with Lian Santon.  At first she told me the charge was because the company undercharged me for the vehicle.  When I explained that I made the purchase through hotwire, she then switched the reason for the charge to me upgrading my vehicle at the counter, which was incorrect.  After being placed on hold for a while, she told me the fee was for fuel, yet I brought the vehicle back on full.  After being placed on hold for over 30 min, she told me that they would only be able to credit back $8 and not the full $11.52 because the other $3.52 was included in taxes.  Another representative called back to tell me that the company would have to call the car rental location and verify that the car was brought back on full before I could receive the other $3.52.  This is pointless to me because if an associate entered a fuel charge in error and the transaction happened weeks ago, it would be difficult to remember this particular transaction given the large volume of rental returns that have taken place since then.Horrible customer service from the pharmacy drive thru! They had me waiting over 45 minutes and they kept asking me to drive to the back of the line.  This one pharmacist (might of been the supervisor) even raised his voice to me ! Never going to this location again and i will contact corporate so they are aware of this !One word: AVOID. Zero Stars if possible.  \\n\\nFor what I spent, I could have had a real gourmet sandwich or salad at Wolfgang Puck\\'s cart!  \\n\\n$9 for a salad of a handful of lettuce (I asked to more and the guy grudgingly gave me a few more pieces of the iceberg lettuce with an admonition that he really wasn\\'t supposed to give me more!), and a sprinkling of chopped over-cooked chicken. Thank goodness there was a bit of rice and black beans underneath otherwise the order would have been really dry!  There are plenty of other places in the airport with better food and service than this dirty burrito place. \\n\\nNote to self: don\\'t expect great service or people working in Las Vegas, esp at the airport.So, I want to first off apologize to our waitress because she did do a good job with my friends and I.  I wasn\\'t expecting to drop a car payment for 3 of us for bowling and drinks, so I didn\\'t leave much of a tip.  Food was good, but the bowling prices are criminal!  $8/game are you kidding me?  Luckily I have my own shoes so I didn\\'t have to bend over for that cost too.  Overall, bowling was fun, atmosphere was good but the cost overshadows any fun that was had.  Oh well, lesson learned.ABSOLUTELY DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!\\nMy wife ordered a dining room set on Amazon from this company for $1,200.00 and the table was damaged when received.  We contacted Amazon regarding the damaged product and they contacted the seller for us.  The response was fast and they asked us for pictures of the damaged product, also asking if the receipt noted that the product was damaged or not.  We sent the pics they requested and pics of the box the table was in.  The box was in perfect condition so when the table was delivered I had no reason to open the box and check the table out.  Therefore, the receipt did not list a damaged product.  Furniture Creations solution was to offer us a 15% refund.  ARE YOU SERIOUS!!!  We asked them what good is 15% and stuck with a damaged table.  We told them we loved the chairs and still wanted their product.  We just wanted a replacement table.  Then their response was giving us 20% refund.  AGAIN, ARE YOU SERIOUS!!!  They told us without the receipt noting a damaged product they could not pinpoint where the damaged occurred and per their policy they could not replace the table.  IF THE PRODUCT WAS DAMAGED AND NOTED ON THE RECEIPT I WOULD HAVE TOLD THE DRIVER TO LOAD IT BACK UP AND SEND IT BACK!!!!! WHY WOULD I SIGN FOR A DAMAGED PRODUCT!!!!  Amazon has been monitoring our emails with Furniture creations and have now submitted a claim on our behalf.  Amazon told us that if Furniture Creations does not resolve the issue then Amazon will refund us our money and will remove Furniture Creations from being a seller on Amazon.  Appears Amazon cares about customer satisfaction and is going above and beyond to keep us buying from them.  Cant say the same thing for Furniture Creation.Parked my car with valet, while wet willies was fine. My car was gone through by one of the valets and things were stolen AMERIPARK will do nothing about this because I did not search my car before I left. If you want to go here I suggest you expect one of there valets to dig through the stuff in your car and take what they like AMERIPARK will do nothing they clearly support the drug addict thieves they have working for them. I will not go back.I called numerous times only to get answering machine during business hours. I left message with my phone number . Never received call back . LensCrafters took me right away . Done with this place.Gave WG another chance due to a gift certificate from a horrible experience at another WG. Well I should have declined. The price and quality do not match. The prices are Morton\\'s but the food is Eat and Park. The pumpkin ravioli was flavorless and room temp. The side salad greens were limp and lacking any pizzaz. The beer menu was decent enough but after three chances on food and three really disappointing experiences I\\'ll take my money elsewhere.I\\'m not a huge fan of using Yelp for negative reviews, people take it too liberally and air their grievances when they should just probably seek therapy or get a hobby...\\n\\nBUT this was a terrible experience. \\n\\nDetails aren\\'t exactly necessary. Just get it together. Be polite. Acknowledge people when they\\'ve been waiting an excessive amount of time. Get orders right after clarification several times. And maybe try and make the situation better when none of the above happens.OK BIG MOOD i would just like to mention, I spent 40+ minutes sniffing every bloody candle in the shop to not only leave disappointed, but with a bad migraine. Not only did this put a damper on my love for autumn, but it also wasted 40 minutes of my time that i could of spent at a different candle shop. I went in excited for the holidays, especially excited about the pumpkin spice candle in particular (Which should be renamed ass pie i might add) but now I am over this season as a whole. Its more than ruined for me now. However i have decided to focus on the future. Not dwell on the past. So i expect proper Christmas scents or i will leave a bad yelp review on every b&b in all of north America. And if the winter collection turns out just as bad, you should stick to what you know best. Hand sanitizer.The way these people run a business is despicable . You pay an arm and a leg to be treated like shit. I understand most people that come in here are drunk and retarded, but the staff doesn\\'t have to match them. Good job suckiest place ever. No class.I\\'ve been thinking of trying MMA or cross-fit. My old gym\\'s membership is finishing in two weeks and I was thinking of trying out something new. I found rev MMA website through google, they had very little information posted on their website. I emailed them and they told me I had to go there in person.\\n\\nI went over and they still refused to give me pricing information and asked me to book a separate appointment with Jessica! Jessica is standing right next to me reviewing some paperwork and it is after her last client. She refused to get involved\\nlong story short, after much loud argument and me saying I will not come back another day to know pricing, they told me listen if you are on a budget we start at $128 a month. And it goes up. I picked a tone of \"if you do not have any money do not talk to us!\"\\n\\nAlthough it is within my budget, currently paying 149 at my old gym, I will not go back. They appeared unprofessional and clueless. A very negative environment.I am a tattoo family member. One of the first 100. They have gone so far down hill it\\'s incredible. The bread is always soggy. The fires undercooked. The servers rude on another level. This place peaked 4 years ago. I got my tattoo covered. Never going back. Not worth the wait or your time. It\\'s a shadow of its former self.Do not eat here!!!!! Staff are very rude and loved talking amongst themselves rather than to paying customers. We arrived and waited for a table to be cleaned. Everyone noticed us just standing there but no one was in a rush to clean the tables off so that we could sit. Finally, when the lady went to clean the table she did so about 1/3 of the way and STOPPED to answer the work phone so that she could take an order over the phone, which left us standing! None of the other coworkers seemed bothered by it either bc no one stepped in to clean the table. After the phone order was taken another customer who was leaving wanted to pay his tab so, this same worker then proceeded to cash him out first before cleaning the table for us to sit down. Lastly, after we stood for a good 7-10mins (waiting for a table) before the worker cleaned it. When it was time to take our order she did so in a whispering manner! But was heard speaking way louder to her coworkers. I had to ask her several times what she was saying. The workers were extremely loud and playful and talked a lot about their personal lives. It was SO many workers there but no true team work at all!!!! One worker kept staring at me while he was on the bacon line! Very Weird!! Food was okay. My bf asked for grits but got hash browns. No one wore hair nets! JUST HORRIBLE SERVICE!! Should have trusted the reviews. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, SERVICE!!!!! Go some place else!This place.... where to begin.\\n First off, my lady and I saw this place and decided to stop there because our normal pho spot had a line out the door. We were greeted to whom I\\'d assume was the owner of the establishment. She was a very nice, slightly older woman. My lady and I were seated right away by the nice lady. \\n\\nAbout 10mins of waiting, this older gentleman comes to take our order. My lady orders her food and hot green tea and water, but not before placing an order for potstickers. He takes my pho order with water, but he can\\'t seem to get away fast enough. 10 more mins of waiting a young waiter comes to the table with the potstickers but no water or tea. My lady asked for a green tea smoothie since they forgot our beverages. They came back to inform us they were out of the Matcha green tea smoothie, So my lady asks for the peach smoothie then. 5mins later they comeback and say they have no more peach smoothie. So she asks if they have the mango smoothie and the waters we ordered at the start and I slide a diet coke order in there at this time. The gentleman comes back with the smoothie and waters but not my my soda.. Innocent mistake. I taste the potstickers and they are cooked but cold which makes me wonder how long they were out and if they were from an order that was sent back or changed. Maybe that\\'s why they got to the table so quick. \\n\\nOur food gets to the table along with my diet coke. I have the beefball pho which taste pretty good. My lady has the beefball pho with added steak which also taste pretty good. We are eating and talking, our drinks are empty for about 10mins and no waiter to be found. Im looking around and notice the place isn\\'t to packed. So where is the service?! About 20mins into the drink wait the nice lady who greeted us sat a couple tables away looks over and sees our drinks empty and tells one of the waiters to fill our drinks. Damn, it takes the head cheese cracking the whip to get some water refill and order another drink.\\n\\nOh and they charge for everything even if you get water and say \"no ice please.\" Yeah, they charge you for the \"no ice.\"\\n\\nThe pho I\\'d rate it a 2 ...maybe..meaning it would do in a pinch, but the service  F-ing sucked. Negitive rating if I could for service. \\n\\nWill not return and do not/will not recommend.My boyfriend just got the worst food poisoning from your Subway last night. He had the Rotisserie chicken and has been puking straight from 4-9am. We will never eat here again. Unfortunate because we live across the street. We\\'ve been trying to call you all morning and you don\\'t answer your phones. It\\'s pretty ridiculous. \"Eat Fresh\" more like \"Kill me now\"They claim low rates?  BS ... my son and his girlfriend broke down in Los Angeles and needed to rent a car to get to Phoenix.  He is 22 and his 1 day rental came out to $212!  AND, he had gotten to Riverside and had to turn around because bone head at Anaheim Enterprise left his keys in the rental ... they gave a small percentage off and no help on added fuel and bill was still $212!  Go to Budget!  Cheaper and they also rent to under 25 as long as you have a credit card and they didn\\'t charge a one way fee.  He rented at budget for return to Anaheim for $68.Nice atmosphere. Very nice presentation of the meal. Friendly staff. Food was awful at best. Very bland cardboard. We did have a party of 14, but seated at 6pm saw 1st pizza at 6:30 and the last pizza came out at 7:55. Other groups came at and left before we were even finished being served. Felt bad that others in my party had to wait to be served below par food. The staff did apologize and comp 3 pizza and offered a dessert.  Oh I forgot, when they brought out the kabob. It was raw. They forgot to cook it. Oops! Not a good experience. Will not recommend or return. To be clear. Wait staff were very kind and gracious. The problem is the kitchen.This is a company you cannot trust. Initial contact was made early August and was good with their employee Sean Hansen, and then it went downhill. I got the warranty and as my luck had it, I broke the screen on the phone. Sent it to them for repairs. Didn\\'t hear anything back. Sent them an email and was told that it would take 10 business days for Samsung to repair the phone. 10 Business Days later, after not getting any update, I contacted them and was told my phone was locked to Samsung and Google and they couldn\\'t replace the screen. Wait, since when does a phone need to be unlocked to replace a screen?\\n\\nEspecially since it\\'s factory reset per their instructions. I sent a heated email and he didn\\'t respond. Finally responded with a rude email telling me that if i was rude in my email again then he would not respond. Great customer service? NO! He then stated that my order to repair the device would be canceled and phone sent back. Now it\\'s been over 2 months and the company still has not sent the phone back, has not responded to any emails and has basically stolen a $1,200 phone. Now, I\\'m seeking legal representation to sue this company for damages because they simply are a rip-off company. \\n\\nUPDATE: 10/12 - CEO of the company contacted me. Was a very nice man that sent me the phone back. Will finally have my phone back after 3 months.Went in for a broken finger, was asked if I was in pain in which I stated no I was fine, when I got to the next station she gave me a lortab!!! I was confused because I had just told the previous nurse that I had zero pain! So I took the pill as I thought maybe they were going to do somethings to my finger in which I would be in pain!! Get my X-ray done, doctor comes by and tells me it\\'s broken but I won\\'t need surgery and that the nurse would splint it and I was to make a follow up appointment!! Well another nurse came and got me and took me to discharge once we got there and she bid me farewell I asked who was going to splint my finger!!!! So she took me back and asked the guy that sits at the front and checks people in to splint it, well he asks which finger and I tell him, he proceeds to put the splint on the finger next to the broken one and he put it on the top side of my finger instead of the bottom to keep it from bending!!!! My girlfriend had to splint it correctly!!!! Smdh!! I asked the discharge lady if it was correct she called the nurse who tried to discharge me without treatment and she asked which finger was broken and that if he splinted it that way then it must be correct!! Come to find out the guy who splinted my finger was a volunteer!!!!!!I\\'m not even sure I want to see the doctor they referred me to if he is affiliated with this hospital!!the only reason the planet got  one star is because it doesn\\' \\'t go wanaaay lower.\\n\\nbuying a car from these frauds is more painful than having a wisdom tooth pulled!\\n\\n they play you; they lie; they totally disrespect you.\\n\\nthis is a shit on buyer!  used car lot.\\n\\nthey played me evjey which way and up!\\n\\ni am so looking forward to do a  rerun.\\n\\ni want to see the assholes shit!\\n\\nwhat a scam!\\n\\nstay  far far away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\n\\nany favorable reviews are planted by wives, sisters, friends, and kinfolk!\\n\\nstay away from this joint!\\n\\nAND COUSINS.  CLOSE COUSINS!Two doors. Is one an entrance? Is one an exit? Are they both exits? They should be cause you\\'ll really wanna leave this place once you\\'re inside. \\nFirst off, We based a book off its cover but it was better than I expected based on the outside. Took a while for waitress to come by. I saw a special for $5 bloody Mary\\'s on their photos on yelp but didn\\'t see it on the menu here. Thought I\\'d ask anyway and it, in fact, was a special. Who knew? Not anyone else unless they were on Yelp. Also got an order of 10 wings (oh you just wait). Bloody Mary came out and before coming out I said \"you can\\'t go wrong on a Bloody Mary\". But they did. My Bloody Mary was weak and watered down. Kinda like I\\'ve been drinking it for an hour already. We got the honey gold wings and the sauce was good. The wings themselves were overly crispy and didn\\'t have much meat on them. AND they only gave 7 wings instead of the ordered 10. Didn\\'t really bother asking for the remainder. We left and likely not going to return.If you want fresh food  don\\'t go to this place . My fries tasted like they reheated them in a microwave, my avocado was mostly black with a few spots green.It\\'s Christmas Day and I won wife of the year because my husband and I traveled 4 hours to watch the game. We get there and every single member of the support team was wonderful. We search for our seats and no one could find them. The usher sits us and says enjoy. Seconds later this guy, Mike (a supervisor) comes up and says you can\\'t sit here. We say no worries please help us find our seat. He says (with the shit face) this is your seat but I gave it to someone else! With a asshole straight face and tells us to move. But it was our seat! Way to go hiring manager. You hired a good one. No customer service skills whatsoever. Is this how you you treat your visitors?\\nMike sucks. Merry Christmas to usChild labor. I encourage you to look at Sandra\\'s reply. This is obviously a very angry and disturbed woman. You would have to be disturbed to use child labor to begin with. She is clearly trying to save herself and her business. The humiliation of breaking the law and treating their customers poorly must really be getting to her. She was incredibly rude to my wife and my wife was the one who pointed out her unpleasant attitude and demeanor. The only reason they have so many good reviews is because they offer free naan with a yelp review. Not a good experience last night. To begin, the appetizers we ordered were lamb samosas. They were terribly seasoned and way too salty. No too spicy--too salty. Waaayyyyyyy too salty. \\nHere\\'s the REAL REVIEW: We felt very judged and spoken down to by the corpulant woman walking around the dining room. I hate to be crass, and normally I would not be so crass, but we were treated horribly. There are a hundred more appropriate and refined words I could use, but the white lady, Sandra, (we are also both white) with vitaligo is a b**** (I find this description highly appropriate) (maybe she\\'s the manager, maybe the bartender or just a hostess). I think that\\'s the perfect word to describe her. She slammed her sweaty hands down on the table and informed us that we couldn\\'t combine a Groupon with the yelp check-in offer, which was fine. She seemed to make a much bigger deal out of this than we did or would have. She seemed offended that we even asked. We told her it was totally fine and that we would happily use the Groupon instead of the check in offer. It\\'s not like we\\'re hurting for money. This is scottsdale. We are two young professionals with great careers. It is rare that I leave a bad review (check my profile). However, the way she smugly and angrily delivered this news along with her condescending attitude, speaking to us like were were stupid or cheap, is why I am writing this review. You can see in her response she does accuse me of being cheap (I was going to leave nothing, my wife left her the dollar). She was exceedingly rude to us throughout this unfortunate dining \"experience\". I presume this is because one or a combination of several reasons, perhaps because of how nicely my wife and I were dressed in designer clothing (which is the norm in PV, we had just come from Neiman Marcus), or perhaps because of our sports car parked out front (clearly visible from the entranyway) in relation to our young age or perhaps it was simply because we asked to be seated near the window rather than near the young children sitting at the bar. Regardless, when serving others you should exude politeness as that is your job. We had been nothing but polite as customers from the moment we arrived. She has been giving us awful looks since we got here, especially to my wife. There are loud Indian children sitting AT THE BAR. I\\'m pretty sure this is illegal and will be posting the pictures of these obviously underage kids playing their videogames at the alcoholic bar. The food was mediocre and not at all authentic. We will not be back even if the food was better--because of this unfortunate and angry woman. Indian paradise is WAY better. We also asked the girl pouring our water how old she was. Guess what she said? \"I\\'m 11.\" They have 11 year olds working here. That is illegal and we will be reporting them. I\\'ll also be posting pictures. I can tell you this, we will not be leaving north scottsdale to eat. The only reason we even went here was becaise my wife is an avid grouponer and it was close to the mall. EDIT: You don\\'t get rich by throwing money away. You shoukd kever criticize someone for using a promotion that your business is offering no matter how much money you think they do or don\\'t have. Sandra, allow me to loosely quote you \"I knew from the moment you didn\\'t get your naan you were giving us a one star review ....\" and you want to accuse us of discrimination? You may think were were rude, but at least we aren\\'t servers. Go do something with your life other than taking out your own insecurities on others. Even if you want to be a server, be a better server. We will be spreading this on Facebook and to our friends. I find it hilarious and sad that you found the need to send such a lengthy response. You probably voted for Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders and have the gall to talk about hard work in America. I stand by everything I said. This woman is just trying to save her own a**. (to be crass and \"unprofessional\" again.I like this place!  Got there around 4p on a Sunday afternoon, sat in the bar area, very few others were there.  Lots of windows, tv action, nice bar, tables and chairs your run of the mill variety; looks like they have patio seating just outside.\\n\\nChips and salsa were good.  Got a bowl of Albondigas Soup, off the regular menu, was $4.95, a true bargain--the soup was terrific, had 4 good size meatballs, full off flavor as was the broth. I\\'d definitely come back just for that soup. \\n\\nUPDATE 10/16/15\\n\\nSo I came back for the soup.  It bore absolutely no resemblance to my earlier visit, was not good.  The house Margarita tasted more like water than anything else.  As goes the soup, goes the stars I previously awarded, so I\\'ve downgraded my review.  Won\\'t be returning.I am pretty patient guy when i take a cheap flight but allegiant is by far the worst company i have ever flown with.\\n\\nWay to vegas from junction plane was 1.5hrs late then leaving vegas to grand junction we were told we had to board an hour early. Then we didn\\'t leave until scheduled time. Sat on the tarmack for 40 min because the proper paperwork to take off was not done with the airport. Of course the A/C didnt work. Ready for take off and now the hydraulic light issue causes us to change planes.   Not bad enough? Flight attendants were so  rude on both flights. \\nNext time i will pay the $100 more. They obviously dont careLeaky ceilings, broken air conditioning, clogged sinks, tweakers everywhere, unreliable staff that doesn\\'t communicate with each other, overpriced and not worth it. Just when you think one issue is resolved another one arises. Every time you speak with someone in the office they either 1) say they will call you back and don\\'t  2) give you different answers than the other person. Maintenance doesn\\'t respond for days  and they lie and say they repair the damage when they really don\\'t. You literally have to harass them to get anything done and it still takes about a week. Pay the extra 200 dollars a month to live somewhere else. Not worth it at all. I repeat. NOT WORTH IT. Ambulance is here every other day. I would leave no stars if I could.Jan 15th, 16\\nOrder my pizza extra well done and it came under cooked.  The service is great, and they rushed out another one but still not cooked properly.  Although I give an A for Effort the  it is spelled with and \"E\" and that is what the pizza was.  Only had 2 slices!!! Extremely disappointed.  \\n\\nThis was my second time ordering from Gino\\'s the 1st was from store #41 in Niagara.  And, although I was very pleased with the quality of the pizza as well as the service I couldn\\'t score it a 5. Maybe store #41 is just that much better than the others...again, very pleased overall.So went on Friday night and evidently they stop serving the drinks on there menu after 10 I believe, probably because the bartenders can\\'t make them. \\n\\nI waited 31 minutes for a bartender to address me as I watched them serve every girl in the bar before me. The menu says the beer I ordered was $5, I was charged $11. So I didn\\'t order more because I was lied to. \\n\\nI left after staying and being miserable for two hours. When we left the music was so loud I couldn\\'t hear anything like I was under water. \\n\\nI hope I never get dragged here again.Ordered a jack on the rocks. It came out clear. Hmm I wonder if they water down their liquor. Yea, we won\\'t be back.UPDATE: I have been a loyal customer for going on 8 years. they moved the 1 guy that knows how my body works, got a facial and ended up with chemical burn, they refuse to refund. tonight I have a 2 hour appointment with Jon who is amazing, and unfortunately because of his bosses, and their treatment of me, I will never be returning.\\n\\nthey are raising prices AGAIN - and not giving the customer service I recommended them for over the last several years. I am very pissed off, and have every right to be. I was told \"the owner knows, he doesn\\'t care\" and not even an apology for the chemical burn, which resulted in a $300 bill to urgent care. \\n\\nI regret losing jon and what he can do for my pain - but their staff is not worth the stress. stay far away, and do not ever go here.\\n\\n\\noriginal:\\n\\nMy massage therapist is Jon. I have been seeing him for over 7 years, and followed him from the location they pulled him from in Mesa, including triple the drive time just to keep him. \\n\\nI have a few genetic disorders, he always asks what is worse, and focuses extra time on the problem areas, I actually have him on my medical records as my physical therapist because he took the time to educate himself on my conditions to make sure what he could do would be effective and help in the long term. I cannot recommend him enough - however, if you overbook him to where I can\\'t walk again - we might have a problem. \\n\\n2 problems I do have with the new location - their new receptionist has scheduled appointments wrong twice now within the last month - as someone who needs her physical therapy on time; this is beyond aggravating, and painful to wait because of an error they don\\'t even apologize for. \\n\\nThe other issue is, I needed a facial, decided why not try getting one there. I came out with just as many black heads as I did going in. It was not worth the 70 plus tip for an hour. \\n\\nEven with these 2 setbacks, I will continue to go for Jon, and ONLY Jon. He is worth putting up with a dingbat, I will just have to triple check appointments from  now on, and make sure the owner is aware of it.This business is absolute RIPOFF. If here was 0 stars that\\'s what it would have been. I have been a customer for a year and as my warranty was going to expire I received a call to renew- as I did. Well.....my AC decides to blow hot air (it\\'s dead summer July with115 days) and a tech comes out 3 days later (we know it can get busy in the summer time so we understand) and we are told it\\'s low on free on....we paid for free on as well the $60 it was taken care of, 3 wks later same problem....now it takes another 2 days before a tech can come out and the problem now is that it\\'s leaking.....who ever added the free on didn\\'t catch the leak....so now that is taken care of and patched up......4 wks later same problem- blowing hot air......AGAIN! No tech available for 4 days not until Saturday.....NOW IM FURIOUS, what kind of people are you sending out where the problem is NEVER SOLVED I have children and it\\'s dead summer. A tech finally comes out Saturday morning and replies....\"I know the problem it\\'s LEAKING but I don\\'t have time to fix it today because it will take too long and it\\'s MY Saturday and I\\'m tired!\" Are you freaking kidding me!!!! Long story short....we had no AC for 7 days. Spoke to both National Home Warranty as well as who they were contracted with, it was a run around to speak to any managers let alone even get their contacts. This place is TERRIBLE. DO NOT USE THEM AS YOUR HOME WARRANTY. I wish I would have seen these reviews prior but I will tell you that what these people are saying is very accurate because it has happened to me. A wise man says its best to learn from someone else\\'s mistake then make that mistake yourself.What a HORRIBLE PRACTICE!! They schedule appointments on top of one another.  I\\'m serious.  3 people in the waiting room scheduled for Dr. Ferry at the SAME appointment time.\\nSo, after waiting 30 minutes,  I went up to the window and asked how much longer I needed to wait.  They ushered me into an exam room very shortly thereafter.\\n\\nHere\\'s where it gets UGLY.  I\\'m sitting in the exam room for a good 10 minutes.  I hear the door to the exam room directly next to mine open.  Then I hear this:\\n\\n\"Hello, Mr. ____, I\\'m Dr. Ferry.\"\\n\\nNow, remember, I\\'ve already been waiting 40 minutes past my appointment time.  AND there are TWO people still sitting in the waiting room with the exact same appointment time as mine and this A-hole has us stacked in exam rooms as well????\\n\\nThis is blatantly rude, greedy, and unkind.\\n\\n\\nI strapped my leg brace back on and crutched right out the door!\\n\\nAs I\\'m leaving they\\'re yelling at my back---\\n\"Hey!  Where are you going?\"\\nSo I replied--\"I know when I\\'m being played.\"  and kept thumping my way out the door.\\n\\nThe 2 other poor saps were still waiting in the waiting room.  With a 3 pm appointment like mine.  \\nDid I mention that someone else spoke up that had a 3:15 appointment?\\n\\nI got to the elevator at 4:15 pm.   \\n\\nI understand if doctors are running behind, but sending a receptionist out to say,\\n\\n\" I\\'m sorry, we\\'re runnning behind, if you\\'d like to go get a cup of coffee, we can text you when the doctor is ready , or if you need to reschedule, we understand.\"\\n\\nWould be the kind and polite thing to do.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a lady waiting before me that was afraid to go the restroom!!!!!!!!\\n \\n\\n\\nDr. AMON FERRY needs a good wake up call.  Or maybe a slap to the head or a kick to the tender area.\\n\\nMy appointment was AGES ago, and I\\'m STILL angry.  The whole experience was SO RUDE, I still can\\'t believe it really happened.I just recently started shopping at this company.  Still trying to evaluate how the clothing will work out at this point.  However, the encounters I have had with their employees have not been pleasant.  I feel the definitely need improvements in customer service.  There seems to be a lot of flawed logic in their company policies.  At least the interpretation of them by employees.  Will likely avoid this store.  Not sure how online service is though.This is the worst customer service I\\'ve ever been to. I ordered the drunken noodle that suppose to be wide rice noodle but I got the egg noodle instead. I called and they said that\\'s the kind of noodle they made in their drunken noodle which is the worst!!!! Called again cannot return or exchanged. Bad bad bad bad bad bad bad!!!!! The lady up front yelled at me and said if you want another one you have to buy a new one.. really????? I wish I can put a neg star!!!I hope you are never forced to use this pharmacy by your insurance. I would give them zero stars if possible. You will spend hours on the phone with them to end up with the wrong medication that they will refuse to take back while talking in circles about it\\'s not there fault. And they could care less if your loved one life is on the line.I wouldn\\'t give them any stars.  I am stuck in Albuquerque, NM because this airline delayed my flight twice and then decided to cancel it.  Had to wait 60 mins on the phone to find out my next step.  They rescheduled the flight to leave at 330pm the next day and would not tell me the reason why my flight was cancelled.  We asked to be rescheduled on a different airline as we both need to be in Las Vegas by morning and were informed that this airline doesn\\'t do that.  Buyers be aware you get exactly what you pay for.  I rather pay a higher price with another airline than to spend one penny with this airline again.  Big disappointment.Where do I begin?\\n\\nThe welcome was warm and inviting.... friendly. Then the chips came with 2 kinds of salsas. I am a bit confused. They\\'re American Cantina chips. Where\\'s the authentic deep fried tortilla chips???? Negative 5 points. The salsas were mediocre. I didn\\'t taste the authenticity of the flavors. \\n\\nNow, many will rant like crazy about me:\"you\\'re Asian, what do you know about Mexican food?\" Let me tell you to--PAUSE, hold on to your tas-tas, and let me finish my review. When you grow up in TACO FLATS USA-California, your expectations are set high. Why? Because Juan, Jose & Maria\\'s grandma used to do a lot of Latin foods. You definitely could even go to Sal\\'s little taco stand and receive the best Buche taco and never looked at it any differently. Yes, be spontaneous and allow yourself to go balls deep into trying everything once.... enough said. Muchas Gracias! \\n\\nPros:\\n\\nGreat customer service \\nBig portions for what you pay for\\nOpen bar\\nFamily friendly \\nClean\\n\\n\\nCons:\\n\\nLack of authenticity in Latin flavors\\n\\nChips-cantina style\\nSteak over cooked (ordered med. rare)\\nSalsas lacked flavor\\n\\n\\n#chipotlebeatsLosCucos worst part..... I HATE CHIPOTLE FRANCHISE.... I am all about small joint places and support local businesses! \\n\\nSo, I warned you. \\n\\nYou\\'re welcome.Listen, the food here is great. The employees very attentive and nice. My problem is the absolutely ridiculous side charges for something that should be a part of the meal. $10.95 for a lunch of meatloaf I can live with, what is a normal side with meatloaf? Why yes mashed potatoes, well if you want that here it\\'s $2.95 extra so now we are at basically $14.00 for lunch. Get my meal and its a little tiny, tiny bowl of potatoes, ugh, ask if I could have some gravy for the potatoes was told sure but thats $1.00 extra. Are  you kidding me. Absolutely crazy. Will certainly reconsider ever going here again. It\\'s like booking an airline flight where you have to pay extra for everything.DO NOT USE MIRACLE TOUCH!\\n\\nSimilar to other poor Yelp reviews, he is next to impossible to get a hold of, let alone schedule an appointment.  I called several times and was greeted with \"mailbox full.\" According to positive Yelp/Groupon reviews, it looks like he can do a good job, but would you want someone who is capable of being so unprofessional coming to your home and working on your car? It took contacting Groupon and in turn them contacting him for him to finally give me a call.  See my communications with Groupon below below.\\n\\nMe: Issue: The business is not returning my calls \\nDeal concerned: miracle-touch-auto-finish-restoration-las-vegas-1 \\nGroupon CS: Thank you for contacting Groupon. My name is Jaya P\\nGroupon CS: Hi, how may I help?\\nMe : Hi. I\\'ve tried to contact the merchant several times over the past several days via phone and via SMS.\\nMe : The merchant sent me an SMS on 4/24 stating that he would call me on 4/25, but no such phone call was ever received.\\nMe : I tried calling again today...\"voice mail box full.\" Tried texting this morning, no response. \\nMe : Please issue a refund for this deal asap.\\nGroupon CS: That is a reall trouble. But unfortunately, this Groupon is non-refundable. Please be aware that due to our return policy, we can only offer refunds within three days of purchase for Local deals. \\nMe : What?\\nMe : You won\\'t give a refund for a deal from a merchant that one cannot even contact?\\nMe : That\\'s FRAUD!\\nGroupon CS: Not to worry, your Groupon is eligible for a Trade In. When you Trade In your voucher, you\\'ll automatically receive Groupon Bucks equal to amount you originally paid for this deal.\\nMe : I buy Groupons often, but I do not want Groupon Bucks. I need a refund. I paid Groupon for a service which is not redeemable.\\nMe : Common sense dictates that the customer is due a refund.\\nGroupon CS: If you would like us to look into this forward and get you scheduled, we will be able to do that. If you give us your permission.\\nMe : You may do so, but like I said, I\\'ve made several attempts to contact him.\\nMe : Please schedule me asap.\\nGroupon CS: Thank you, shall I go ahead? Before I do, could you please provide me with your best contact phone number? We may request that they contact you directly, so we ask for your permission to share your contact information with them\\nMe : If you\\'re not able to do so within the immediate future, I\\'ll need a refund.\\n\\nFollow up email to Groupon:\\n\\nThe merchant did finally contact me via phone.  I scheduled an appointment for his earliest available which was today, 4/29/2017, at 1PM.  I offered to send him my work address via SMS (text message) to which I agreed.  I sent the said address via SMS to which he did not respond or confirm receipt.  At approximately 9AM today, I sent him a text asking that he confirm receipt of the address and the 1PM appointment.  He did not respond.  Even though I started to doubt that he would show up for the appointment, I still waited for him in case he did show up.  He did not.  He finally called at 1:45 PM, 45 minutes past the appointment time.  He said, \"I\\'m supposed to do your car this afternoon.\" I responded, \"I\\'ve been waitng for you for 45 minutes.  I sent you a text this morning asking that you confirm the appointment.  You didn\\'t respond.\"  The merchant responded/yelled, \"I don\\'t know what issue you have going on over there but I\\'M NOT COMING NOW!\"  He then yelled expletives and cursed at me.  I simply hung up on him during his yelling/cursing rant.\\n\\nI do not know what is wrong with your merchant, but he definitely has issues.  What kind of business person treats and talks to a customer that way especially after making every attempt to contact and schedule an appointment?  He wasted my time, money, patience and graciousness.  As was discussed in our previous chat session, I gave the merchant a second chance.  He failed miserably to perform the purchased service.  Please refund to the original form of purchase as soon as possible.  Please note that \"Groupon Bucks\" is not an acceptable form of refund.  I did not change my mind about the purchase.  I really did want him to perform the service as it would have been a great deal if he actually completed the work.  I recommend that you highly reconsider having this business featured on Groupon.  Thank you.I had a horrible experience here, called asked if they were busy said they weren\\'t.  I showed up let them know I wanted a full set and a reg pedicure.  I was set in a chair given a very short \"reg pedicure\" led to a table where my full set was done. I pointed out that my nails were too wide, too thick and several are crooked. She said it will be alright. It\\'s Not! Then she asked if I wanted my cuticles trimmed, it took 4 more min no problem. Then I asked for my total, she said she needed my card, I said how much? She came back after running my card and I had to ask her again for the breakdown. It was $78 For full set w/gel and a regular pedicure. That was after happy hour discount of $8.  It was $5 extra for calus removal and $10 extra for the express mani extra 4 min to clean up cuticles. Never going back! RidiculousI use the grocery pick up here and it\\'s the worst! They have forgotten to send items (that I paid for) 6 or 7 times total. Every time I call and inform them of their mistake they apologize, explain how they don\\'t know what happened, and ask if I can go pick up the forgotten item. Really!? I use this service as a convenience and now I have to go back and pick up a 2nd time because of their employees mistakes!? They could at least deliver it. So here I go back to the store because I need the item and they give me a mini wal mart tote, I know have at least 5 of those.  I have continued shopping there because it is nice to pick up groceries and I think maybe they will have all my items. Not the case! I order the groceries and my wife picks up so she doesn\\'t know everything on the list and they don\\'t even give a receipt. I called the other day furious and the lady I spoke with said the grocery team was not there and she would pass the message along to the manager. I have heard nothing and this was Tuesday. It is now Saturday. I will not be using them anymore and I suggest none of you do unless you would like to experience all of the loveliness above.My husband and I went to Sea Witch tonight for dinner.  I\\'m suuuuuuper pregnant and today is actually my due date.  Pretty exciting.  Pretty pumped to eat some fish and chips in our new \\'hood.  Celebrate what is possibly our last day as non-zombie parents.  Happy day happy day!\\n\\nWalked up to the door of Sea Witch...slowly because I\\'m as big as a damn house, and the dude literally locks the door in our face.  Just looks at us and shrugs.  Seriously?  Seriously?!  It was exactly 8pm, and a couple of non-preggos with fully functional bodies walked in an were seated not one minute before us.  I just couldn\\'t get there fast enough.  It takes me 10 minutes to get out of bed right now.  Cut a girl some slack.\\n\\nCold, dude.  Cold.  So thanks for making this hugely pregnant woman cry on her due date (because fat preggos cry over literally everything).  Now I\\'m at home waiting for delivery pizza, and will never come back to Sea Witch.\\n\\nAlso to the dude that locked the door in our faces and just shrugged like \\'whoops, the door is locked foreverzzzzzz\\', I hope that you\\'re a woman in your next life and get super fat and people are mean to you.I went here because I had a Groupon.  I\\'ve been to several other places for botox before and never had any problems.  Until I came here.  Didn\\'t have to wait long before being taken back to the room by the nurse.  While she was getting everything prepared she commented on how she had just eaten lunch and was tired.  Not what I wanted to hear from someone about to inject my forehead.  Then her cell phone rang and instead of silencing it she picked it up and made her vacation plans while drawing up the botox.  I had to wait until her call was completed, then she began to aggressive stab and inject the botox into six sites on my forehead.  I was appalled at the manner in which it was done.  I\\'m an RN, and I\\'ve had this done many times before, and this is NOT how you inject.  She then took her thumbs and firmly rubbed the spots she had injected as if she were spreading it around.  This is WRONG!!!  Now I\\'m left with a huge bruise on my forehead.  I\\'m lucky that it\\'s the worst thing that happened from this visit.  I would never go back, no matter how cheap or how good of a deal it is.If you\\'re looking for sub standard food, steak not cooked right the first time and when you send it back it comes the exact same way, service that doesn\\'t write down what you want as sides or takes forever for drink refills than this is the place to be. \\n\\nI understand that this is a chain resteraunt and the level of giving a crap about your customers is low but I\\'m still spending money...They include the tips in the final price on the receipt, but did not even tell the customers about that. So it is highly possible that most people double tipped them. However, their service is not good at all.If i could give 0 stars I would. Awful awful awful! What a waste of my time and money. Ordered the 4 piece shrimp and chips & 2 piece fish 7 shrimp, ended up with 3 pieces of fish and 9 shrimps that were so completely covered in their breaded stuff you couldn\\'t even enjoy the shrimp. I will never go to this location again.When bad pizza and service go bad. No hot and ready, manager on cell, and doesn\\'t give a shit about customer service. The cashier had to cut pizza and go straight to register without washing his hands. Has anybody had this experience before? \\nThe Little Caesar Pizza manager said she spoke to Mike the owner and that everything was fine. She was more concerned about speaking to the owner and making sure she was heard first before filling up the empty warmers with pizza! \\nMichael, please get an employee that cares about your customers.\\nA couple waited close to five minutes (while I waited, they were sitting waiting on their pizza before I got there) for O-N-E pizza.\\nPlease review your videos from 12:30 to 1pm.I went in for lunch and forgot my rings there. Realized I forgot them maybe five minutes after we left so I called and they said they were holding them for me. My boyfriend showed up to pick them up and he said the lady helping him would not speak English to him, so he got flustered and took what she gave him and left.\\n\\nUpon looking at what they gave him, my vintage silver spoon ring and vintage turquoise ring (all at an almost $100 value) were missing.\\n\\nYou\\'d be hard pressed to find a thief who would work fast enough to sift through my rings before the busser came and steal only the two expensive ones. I\\'m extremely disappointed in this business and it deeply saddens me that Teharu Sushi can stay open as a business and steal from their customers.BAD.  Shockingly expensive, poor quality food.  The salad bar is a nice idea, however it has no lights - how are you supposed to make a salad in the dark?  The inside seating area was dirty and felt like a Denny\\'s in disguise.  Do not waste your hard earned cash here!Went there on 1/3/2014 after purchasing vouchers for myself and 2 friends.  The massage was not the best.  The pressure was inadequate.  After the massages for the 3 of us, they would not let us leave till we left the tips that they wanted $10-15 minimum.  We had to comply in order to leave.  It was very uncomfortable.Managers are pathetic. They don\\'t like to take feedback from customers. I had the worst experience dealing with the folks in the counter....I used to like this place before but never going there again.Fed up with the fake Italian Food this place offers. Ya\\'ll are getting fooled big time in thinking this place has any resemblance to an Italian restaurant. One final attempt today was the Eggplant Parmesan Hero. Well the eggplant was a white color and there was no breading at all on that white eggplant. It was one of the worst versions of this classic I even seen and their chicken parm did equal injustice to that dish a few months back. Not sure what goes on in the back of the kitchen, but I can tell you that I didn\\'t see any Italians back there if you get my drift. The seeded roll with mozzarella cheese became my $8 lunch. Not returning to this place and who the hell wants to wait 30 minutes for a takeout order? They just say that on the phone to give you the illusion that they are high and mighty, like a club with a line outside and no people inside. Uncle Sal\\'s is real better up the street. Later Defalco.\\n\\nOk...white eggplant does exist, but rare. Still doesn\\'t belong in parmesan.Really poor customer service. Worst customer service, in fact. Had a layover and passed this on my way to my gate. I grabbed a premade salad, it wasn\\'t bad but it wasn\\'t good either.I keep trying this place, as it\\'s one of the few places near my office to grab a quick veggie/vegan lunch. The complete chaos was an initial turn off (employees always seem totally confused and disorganized), and on another occasion I had asked for an extra salad option with the falafel bowl and was informed the kid making the food was in training and needed to learn the correct way to make the food... I did get the ingredients I requested in the end, but that was a really strange interaction. The final straw was today, when I came in and ordered a build your own wrap and whatever ingredient (likely the mixed greens or tabbouleh, though it could have been the lentils) was filled with sand. The grit was in every bite, it was disgusting, and I ended up throwing the food away. The produce is obviously not being properly washed. I tried to like this place no less than 6 times, and every time I have been disappointed. Come on guys!Ripped off yet again by this store.  Was in a rush, and very few places left that print photos.  Offered $5 for a glossy print, and $10 for a glossy.  Really? 100% more.  The price was already more than what one would expect for a 8x10, but the relative difference was clearly an attempt to extract more.   Reasonable quality print, but no Black\\'s.  Having experienced this store before, I would have stayed away had there been a choice.Went here with a question to see if my iPhone7 will work with the Verizon network (FYI it won\\'t) \\n\\nThese tricksters pulled a hard credit check without permission. They did this with the use of my drivers license. I even questioned why he needed my DL to continue to see if my iPhone will work or not and he INSISTED that it was to answer my question. I thought, ok maybe he is making a custom SIM card or putting my information in to see if he can pull the phone into Verizon\\'s network. Nope, the whole time he was just running a credit check. Then used the version website to check to see if the phone was able to get on the network. I already told him I did that...waste of time. I work communication networks and this guy straight up lied to my face to get a credit check in. I\\'m sure the manager is telling them to do this.\\n\\nOh, I just found out today that the impermissible application this location submitted has the wrong information...hmm wonder why. I\\'m military and they used the wrong mailing address from my DL. I move all the time, duh!!! Now even if I wanted to switch to Verizon they require 2 proof of residency.Buying experience was great. No pressure. Lane was so helpful he really informed us about the car to help us make our decision versus trying to push selling us a car.  If you are in the market for a car definitely stop in and see the what options you have without the normal sale pressure.\\n\\nUpdate -\\n\\nInitially I gave them 5 stars. I went back into dealership but Lane was not there . I could not believe how badly I was treated.  I will never bring my car back here for service or but another car from this dealership.  It was so bad the sales person looked me up and down and never even introduced himself to me.   I now rate them 1 star . I will take my business elsewhere.This place is bull, I have a friend the just had a party for her husbands 40th, top golf just screwed her. The management is not very cooperative. They have the worst customer service, took all the food and drink chips 1/2 hour before the party ended. Our party of over 20 people will never have a party here. Will go somewhere else.Absolutely piss poor job. The VIP wash was anything but... water spots on my mirrors, dirt and dust all over the inside like it was never touched. For 15+ bucks you should be ashamed of your business and your staff, who is in too much of a hurry to get off the clock that they can\\'t even do their job right.Special finance is a joke. They get you in promising you the stars to make you look like a jerk. Sam was a very rude guy showed me two cars one with high milage the other had body damange. Was told about all these banks they have that help people. Yeah right the sales men r perverts and if your a pretty thing oh they are more and happy to put you in a car. Just stay awayI meet Mike at my storage unit. He looked at the contents of my 10x10 and 5x10 storage and asked questions about what was at the house. I offered to take him my house as it\\'s only a block away but he declined. \\n\\nMike said he would give the information to his boss and his boss would call me back. It\\'s been three days and no call.  \\n\\nFor me that\\'s very poor customer service. If you don\\'t need the business say so, don\\'t just leave customers hanging.I think the only reason why this place has 4 stars is because of the ambiance. The food is awful. I had the pad Thai which tasted extremely fishy (old shrimp) and the tempura shrimp roll was probably the most bland I\\'ve ever had. Edamame was NOT fresh. Horrible horrible horrible!Ordered a bacons cheeseburger and it came with no bacon, friend ordered food and food took an additional 10 minutes to arrive. Garlic fries are very greasy.  Burger is average and rather eat at McDonald\\'s, why come to Vegas and get this kind of crap!!!I always had good memories from this store. I bought many hats, boots and coats. Just now I was there, the owner, she was not treating me well. Never will go again.First of all the owner needs to take a chill pill and let the customer decide on what they want to eat, instead of rushing them with try this , try this, try that...\\n\\nOrdered  a Large Pizza thinking it might have some desi touch to it...\\n\\nBut it was the WORST EVER PIZZA i have ever had.  I think even a freshie would make a better Pizza than these guys...\\n\\nThe Pizza dough was all soggy and very thin, not properly baked....\\nIt tasted like a thin under-cooked bread overloaded with cheese making it to chew a lot....\\n\\nThe above rating is only for the Pizza at this place.... The owner claims to serve one of the best Nihari and Biryani. Will give it a shot in the future and update the reviews if any better...Skip it!  The tenders were rubbery and super salty!  The mashed potatoes tasted like instant!  Canes is way tastier down the street!I went in there about 5 years ago for an inspection and they gave me a list of $2700 worth of repairs I needed to do. I took my car to johns garage in brentwood and he said I didn\\'t even need the majority of the stuff sturman  and Larkin wanted to do and he did the needed repairs for $400. \\n\\nWhen I took it to sturman & Larkin for the free re-inspection they passes my car even though I only got half the repairs they claimed I needed done.Today I had an appointment at 2pm and I arrived there at 10min to 2pm just to be sure I got there with enough time to spare. I ended up waiting for 30 min and the walk-in people that came in after me got seated first. Apparently, this place doesn\\'t honor appointments. I might as well not have taken my time to call two days ahead to set up an appointment. I was disappointed. I saw the techs hurrying with their job just to get to the next one. After 30 min, I called up another nail salon place to see if I can just walk in and be seated right away. I left as soon as I hung up. \\nI went to another nail salon and got serviced right away. They were very friendly and clean and they did an awesome job with my nails including nail art. \\n\\nAnyway, if you can\\'t honor your appointments you might as well make it as a walk in ONLY service. I thought that in business your word is you honor. Apparently not this place.This place is an abomination. I have been a resident here for over a month, trying to get a shower here is pretty much impossible, even though I request them on the two days a week they decide to shower us. I have had 2 showers and 1 bed bath since my check in. The occupational therapy is pretty much a joke. They don\\'t teach you anything on how to do for yourself outside of the hospital, they simply show you mediocre exercises you can YouTube or Google and ignore you. So basically they are stealing from insurance by saying they are doing therapy when you could do the same things in your room and not wasting your insurances money on hokey exercises designed to cheat insurances. They won\\'t contact your physician no matter how many times you tell them to. I checked in and told them of an appointment 3 weeks out and the day before the appointment after asking numerous times for X-rays for the appointment they said they knew nothing of the appointment and scrambled trying to get X-rays and transportation set up. When I got to my appointment they forgot to send my X-rays with me! I called the hospital and spoke to the Director of Nursing Tonya Hampton and she said they just wanted the finalized report not the X-rays... As the doctor is asking me at the appointment for the much needed X-rays. If you need pain meds or just your call light answered be prepared to wait anywhere from 45 minutes and up while the nurses congregate around the nursing station ignoring the lights and buzzing sounds informing them of patients in need. I even asked them if they were going to get the buzzing noises or blinking lights only to get the response if \"someone is down there, they will get to it.\" They also run out of your medication on occasion only to tell you tough they will get it in later.  The nurses here do not understand HIPAA (patients personal information and treatment disclosure basically) and when they get upset they talk about you and your treatment to patients. I got this first hand when Dorothy told me about a lazy patient with pnuemonia at the end if my hall. When you inform the Director of Nursing or Director of the hospital they don\\'t do anything about the nurses but they will try to discharge you even before your insurance runs out by saying therapy can longer help your condition. They do move a little when you say you will contact outside services and corporate... Once again after they will try to discharge you. This is even when you are in a wheelchair with nobody to help at home with care or treatment and they never trained you in therapy to be prepared to leave. (Yes even though your insurance paid then $45 every 15 minutes if therapy). So if you want subpar treatment from a center that only looks at you as a paycheck then this is the place for you. (Even the nurses here talk about how your only a paycheck... And how they are totally understaffed because Tonya got rid of employees (shower aid... Remember 2 showers one bed bath 4 weeks with therapy 6 times a week) and never supplied them with the promised extra aid so they are running back and forth trying to pick up the slack from other nurses who don\\'t want to work). The Director is 29 years old and has no clue what he is doing in my opinion. The Director of Nursing is just as bad. Hopefully you read this and do not make the mistake a lot of us patients did by coming to this hell hole run by incompetent leadership.  To say I hate La Estancia with all my heart and soul would pale in comparison to how I really feel.\\n\\nI\\'m guessing the review from Carol K is fabricated by a family friend of the staff. Everyone I talk to here have nothing nice to say about this place.\\n\\nAlso things tend to come up missing here... From food that only the staff has access to, along with a sweatshirt taken out of my room. Things here seem to grow legs.I was very upset at this location. It was my birthday, and all I really wanted was an awesome bowl of fresh made ice cream. As my girlfriend and I are getting ready to park, this car comes speeding right past in front of us to park in the handicap spot. Ok, so I thought, that was just a rude driver...nope, a group what we thought were teenagers jumping out of the car. They proceeded to walk into the ice cream shop. As my girlfriend and I walk in, these teenagers turn out to be employees, because there they were, behind the counter....I was pissed!!! Not only are their employees parking in the handicap spot, but they also almost hit us while we had the right of way. I really hope this was an anomaly, but needless to say, we turned around and walked right out. Now don\\'t get me wrong, the ice cream there is great, but the unprofessional employees have made it so we will not come here anymore. Now...any good suggestions on a new ice cream spot?Wasn\\'t impressed at all.  Had a bad experience at the Cuyahoga Falls location and this one I\\'ve eaten at twice and I\\'m not sure how or why they opened this new location.  Had the Shrimp app which is a copy of Bang Bang Shrimp but it was awful by comparison.\\n\\nI\\'ve also had the smoked pork chop - They soak it in liquid smoke type brine.  It\\'s not smoked so don\\'t advertise as such.  Wife and I were both disappointed in our meals and have not been back since.\\n\\nApplebees much better and more consistent (although that\\'s not where we\\'d choose to go for a nice dinner).  However the ambiance of the place is nice.  That\\'s about it.So, mother always said if you can\\'t say something nice don\\'t say anything at all. When I finally reached someone at Ladlow\\'s after two unanswered voice messages and an email about a bench ordered in September they were quick to refund my deposit after we determined the bench wasn\\'t on order. They blamed it on the manufacturer and slow demand for the piece but the manufacturer said in an email to me they were surprised at that response and couldn\\'t find an order from Ladlow\\'s for the item. I was glad they sent the refund check so quickly. That\\'s as nice as I can be.Overpriced is not even the issue here, I\\'ve had better food and baozi at places that are a fraction of the cost and the portions of some dishes are ridiculous. Came here because I kept seeing their ad everywhere, now I see their need for advertisement. Also when we came in it was pretty filled up on the first floor so we asked to sit on the second level and they told us it wasn\\'t open yet. However 5 minutes into sitting down a couple that was perhaps a frequent customer was immediately shown upstairs. Then another family behind them also asked to sit upstairs and was also refused. What?! Definitely won\\'t be coming back.Absolutely horrible, buffet is about 6 mediocre items that all seem to have come from a can or a freezer box. The service is okay but microwaving some bacon, canned beans and breakfast sausage at home would have been better and not cost me 15 DOLLARS.If I could give negative stars I would! These people are very nasty, rude, uncivilized scum of the earth. They towed my sons vehicle and he is a MARINE OVER SEAS I got the paperwork they requested and they still will not let me get my sons vehicle back! Trying to charge me almost $900.00 and it increases daily! I can not even start to tell you how horrible these scum bags are! I am filing several complaints against them with who ever will listen, DO NOT TRUST THEM!THIS IS A VERY DESCRIPTIVE STORY OF MY ONE AND ONLY EXPERIENCE AT THIS NAIL SALON. TO SUM IT UP, I HAD A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE HERE AND WOULD ADVISE NO ONE TO GO HERE. \\n(See pictures- I had gel nails that looked like that after 5 days and I wore them for 2 weeks). \\nI don\\'t even write reviews but I felt the need to make my first one about this salon because I\\'d rather people not have to experience what I did. \\nIf you DO choose to go here, DONT sit in Tina Pham\\'s chair.\\n\\nTwo weeks ago I decided to go to this nail shop since it was convenient for me (because I had a very eventful day and I needed to cram in a nail repair before continuing with it). I went in and one lady addressed me and I told her I needed a nail repair and a gel nail change (I initially had chrome but they didn\\'t have it there so I had to get a gel polish change). The woman told me it would be $18 and I sat down to look at the color book to choose a color. There was literally only one person in there while I was choosing a color. I did take a while to choose one but she kept bothering me the whole time asking me if I was going to get my nails done or not. So I asked if they were closing (it was about 3:30 pm she said no so I asked why is she rushing me and her and one of her co workers spoke in their language and began to laugh. I ignored it, chose a color, and they sat me down in a lady named Tina\\'s chair. I sat in her chair and it was literally the longest nail repair and color change that I\\'ve ever gotten. When laying down the foundation for my nails she did it very unevenly and was very harsh on my hands. When she put the polish on my nails it looked ok then I accidentally messed up the polish when I put it under the gel dryer that they have and she got upset and grabbed my hand and started wiping at my nail with a paper towel. She didn\\'t use polish remover to wipe of the excess polish but polished over it. After she finished she told me that it would be $33 and I told her that that\\'s not what I was told initially and that I was only paying $18 (which I shouldn\\'t have done anyway) and apologized and asked me not to tell the woman who I spoke to when I first came in the shop. At that point I had to go and was so disappointed with the service that I paid for so I just left and went on about my day. After about 4 days I realized my gel polish began to wear off and it looks horrible (SEE THE PICTURES). Gel polish is not supposed to do that and I will never be returning to this nail shop I\\'d advise no one to ever go there they are very rude and some of their workers are inexperienced.They were dispatched to one of my rental properties by American Home Shield (AHS)to look at a stackable washer/dryer that was not working. All Desert Appliances ordered a transmission and after a few weeks without the use of a washer or dryer my tenant finally replaced the broken fan belt himself and it has been working fine ever since. I contacted AHS and notified them that they were being charged for a transmission that was not needed either through incompetence or malicious intent. I still have to pay the $100 co-pay to these for these guys to do nothing, but try to rip off AHS!!!I had the Thai chicken bowl which was advertised as a red curry. It was probably the worst meal I have ever paid for. There was almost no chicken and no curry - just a mush of nearly unrecognizable vegetables and who knows what else. Stay away.I hate this fucking stinky ghetto shithole. My car was broken into here in broad daylight. There\\'s always unsavory characters lolling about, and that\\'s just the people that work there. They roll one distrustful eye up towards you (the other obscured by emo fringe) and glare at you for even daring to disturb them. As for the people that shop here, if you stand too close, you will probably catch lice and get exposed to tuberculosis in one shot. Every time I come here, without fail, there is some sorry sack of shit at the pharmacist counter, trying to convince them they just \"lost\" their written prescription for Vicodin, or their Percocets got \"stolen\", all with Emmy-award winning shows of anguish and pain. So you\\'re asking now why I even come here, and I don\\'t blame you. I work long hours, and this is the closest 24-hour pharmacy to my humble abode. Sometimes, a girl doesn\\'t have time to  drive to a first-world facility. What can I do, except clutch my bag extra close, scared-old-lady style, and take an extra long shower with extra disinfecting soap when I get home.Soooo this is a new one on me, 30 min wait when half the place is empty this place has dropped off the map in my book as of late. the food has went from excellent to okay. The service has never been up to par but they try to make up for it by giving away free desserts. Which is fine but I would rather get great service and that always makes the food taste better get a grip you guys and tighten it up:0What a waste of an evening. Good thing I ate at Postinos beforehand. Not that the food is any good at Dierks, actually probably just average bar food, but I have no idea as they stop serving food at 9pm on weekends. Wtf? All so they can take hooker looking waitresses around for \\'bottle service\\'.\\nNow just that would have been more tolerable seeing as they do actually play country music, which some country bars do go away from later in the evening. But they took all the chairs and tables away so there is no where to sit unless you overpay for a booth on the outskirts.\\nDefinitely won\\'t be back and don\\'t waste your time going as there are so many better places to hang out in Scottsdale. What a disappointment coming from My wife\\'s favorite country artist. He could do so much betterBeen looking at this place awhile. The yelp reviews are mixed so me and the wife have hesitated. After being tempted by the steak menu (which looks amazing) finally i decided to make a reservation for the wife\\'s birthday. On the website it clearly states locals get a 15% discount. Clearly. So i called the week before to make a reservation for Monday Aug 10th-not a holiday that i know of. I made my reservation then asked about the discount only to be told they don\\'t honor that anymore! ITS ON THE WEBSITE! I emailed the Luxor to explain why i canceled my reservation-and they told me they honor whats on there website(-holidays and weekends i believe) So the hostess has 3 jobs. To take reservations, seat people & know the offers the restaurant has! If she/they cant get that simple communication right-this place isn\\'t worth the phone call i made. I think based on this basic screw up i would not feel comfortable blowing $150-200 for a dinner. To many options in townI ordered and after 40 minutes I get a text that they are closed!!! My credit card was charged and nod I\\'m out of almost $50.00!!! I hope this is settled PROMPTLY!!!Dr\\' Hyson has the personality of a turnip, and has the worst bedside manner I have ever seen. A typical appointment with him goes like this: He comes into the examine room, mumbles an indistinguishable greeting, looks at lab tests, reads the report to you, without making any eye contact at any time and expects you to understand the results without further explanation. If you ask a question, you are treated like you are the stupidest person on earth. If you dare to ask him to do anything, he probably won\\'t do it,. If by some miracle he does, it is accompanied by stern statements, no matter what it is, that he is doing you a \"favor\" and it\\'s \"not my job\". After multiple sessions with him, from what I can see, he views his \"job\" as ordering tests, reading the results to you without explanation, and billing your insurance for an hours time after spending 1 or 2 minutes with you.\\n\\nThe office staff (run apparently by his wife) is rude, incompetent,, and extremely arrogant.\\n\\nAll in all, this was the most miserable medical experience of my life. Dr. Hyson, who is certified as a Psychiatrist, should more appropriately, be the patient of one. His attitude and demeanor absolutely do  not match up with a profession of helping or treating others and he rather reminds me of a person with autism who is incapable of improving social skills or interacting appropriately with others;  His people skills are so bad that I wonder how he keeps his practice going. \\n\\nRun, don\\'t walk from this office. You\\'d be better off getting medical services at the city dog pound, and probably be treated better to boot.One person working and 7 cars waiting. Not only am I handicap waiting 20 minutes but I am going to miss my flight. According to the worker, who is taking his sweet time per car there is only one worker on Sunday\\'s. I called the main number and he said he would bring someone down. When he did he just asked if I was the one who called and then turned around and left. Wow. Can\\'t wait to talk to ADA about this.All I want to do is leave 5 star reviews. Don\\'t you? I\\'m not a pretentious jerk, I just had a really bad experience at Tom\\'s. Unfortunately it\\'s all due to one server, Eddie.\\n\\nThe big issue was when the bill came and it looked like I was overcharged for my food.  I thought the $6 happy hour tacos meant that the 3 tacos that were normally $17, were $6.  What a deal!  Nope, I was wrong.  The tacos were $6 EACH, which is not a deal.  So when I called Eddie over, all he did was argue with me and tell me I was wrong and that if I wanted, he could charge me $18 instead of $17.  Huh?  Why would I want that?  Instead he just threw up his hands and said \"Fine! I\\'ll pay for it then!  Is that what you want?\" and walked away.\\n\\nSoooo as soon as he left, my friends explained to me what Eddie failed to do.  That they were $6 each on the menu.  Oh, shoot, ok!  So when he came back to basically throw the bill at us, I tried to apologize (even though he was rude and didn\\'t deserve) and he wouldn\\'t hear it. \"Nope, nope\" and walked away.  Good talk.\\n\\nThis meal could have gone one way had \"the customer is always right\" been Eddie\\'s attitude.  Look, I used to be a server and of course the customer is wrong sometimes, but you have to leave them wanting to come back.  Unfortunately I won\\'t be back and I won\\'t recommend to my friends.This is scam. I call the company to fix my refrigerator because it can\\'t produce ice and water leak. What I do is unplugged the hose at the back to stop the leak. Then I callthen I message this company to check the problem and I talk to the owner then he charge me 79.00 to chk if there is a problem he change part with my expense. I said fine. He show up in my house by 2pm I\\'m not home my wife is the one who talk to him. He put back the hose and turn on the water that\\'s all he do then left. When I came home the ice maker still not working Of course because he don\\'t do anything so I message back the owner about the problem he said . I saw the hose is not connected and the water is off maybe reason why there is no ice I said I\\'ll take it out then you just put it back then charge me 79.00 to put it back? He don\\'t even chk the problem. I message him and he don\\'t answer me again he just ignore me. Please remember this company don\\'t ever call this. Don\\'t be a victim.I patronized this place after a year of reprieve. I was disappointed in the changes and service. We had a table with a cocktail  waitress who never showed up. After hunting her down and giving $40 for a 60 bill, she pocketed the cash charged the full amount on the 1 cc given. When questioned she acted like She had no idea of her mistake. The male manager was cocky and unprepared for a professional encounter. Did the owner hire his neighbor??? Locals, don\\'t come here... It\\'s not the sameBUYER BEWARE!! This company is a sham!! It also operates under different names, Silverstate Carpet Cleaning - Stainmasters Carpet Cleaning, The Original Stainmasters, etc. Also has different phone numbers. Worst carpet cleaning company and even worse customer service. They are incapable of cleaning a carpet. One word of advice, DO SOMETHING!!! File a report with the Better Business Bureau and if you paid by credit card, dispute the charges with your credit card company. Call channel 13 investigates, Fox 5, The Rant, post it on facebook. Get the word out. They cannot treat customers this way and stay in business. How are they even allowed to keep a license?? Our first and only mistake was not making him leave our home immediately!! I wish I had checked YELP before having them. I did check website testimonials which were all positive of course, I wonder who writes them? Anyway, DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY!!! YOU WILL REGRET IT!!! HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! ZERO STARSBrought my dad here to eat based on the \"good\" reviews BAD IDEA! From the moment we walked in and waited at the hostess stand. After being seated we ordered our drinks we then noticed stuck on food on my dad\\'s plate so when the waitress brought us our drinks he requested a clean plate. All was good. We ordered mushrooms for starters, they were good. Next, we ordered our meals. I ordered \"King\" crab and a lobster tail which also came with a clam chowder soup. The soup was horrible no flavor no meat nothing really just a milk base with a couple potatoes. The crab was a joke there was nothing \"king\" about it unless you were pulling it from your fish tank.  As for the lobster tail it was very pretty but no flavor and on the rubbery side. My dad ordered filet mignon and didn\\'t even eat a quarter of it I think that speaks for itself. Service from our server was good but we won\\'t be back definitely wasn\\'t worth the money next time we\\'ll stick to our original plan of Outback!Please close the \"deli\" or w.e. you would call it. Yall can\\'t handle more than 2 customers at a time and it always takes me 20+ min to get simple things. I have worked in the food industry for 11 years and this place just is under staffed.Great concept and idea that works for the meal plan side when they have time to prep but they need serious help on the deli side. I left after i ordered  a fruit smoothie that ended up being put last in line because other people got food after me. After 15 min of waiting and seeing that it wasn\\'t going to be made soon i had just left. Oh well back to making it myself.Well, something is wrong today. I have eaten at Wahoo\\'s many, many times, both at Las Vegas & California locations. I always get the same thing. They screwed up too many things today. Enough that I am moved to write a bad review. \\n- weird person taking orders, acted bored to death, like I was bothering her.\\n- wasn\\'t given, or even offered my receipt\\n- got my fish order wrong\\n- when given my fish back \"corrected,\" it was not made to order, simply sprinkled the spice on. I have had this spicy fish many times, it is prepared blackened & saturated in spice. They didn\\'t redo it.\\n- salad had no tortilla strips\\nI would like to tell management but there is no one walking the floor. When it is quiet & mid afternoon, that\\'s when a presence by management should be mmadeAfter waiting two weeks for a return call, I had one of the owners pull up in front of my house. He never got out of his truck and said that due to the size of my street and with their equipment they would never be able to do this job. I wanted a roof replaced and some leaky skylights repaired. These guys came pretty solidly recommended but sorry I can\\'t say the same. I live on a typical street on top of the southside, parking across the street and rear access. Honestly, I\\'ve never seen a guy not want a job any less. He didn\\'t even pretend to attempt to try and figure a way to take the job. Must be nice being able to refuse work so easily.If I could pick zero stars I would ! This place is full of cheap clothes that tear on the first wash & their employees are stuck up , useless people . I tried to return a shirt w all tags & the receipt & their manager said I couldn\\'t ! She even tried calling me a liar . NEVER COMING HERE AGAINAwful service.  Went here around 3 pm on a weekday, wasn\\'t busy at all with maybe 15% of the tables being used.  Was sat down quickly and given a drinks menu but not a food menu.\\n\\nI waited 5 minutes while employee after employee walked by, doing other things.  Even met eyes with some of them.  Nobody offered me a drink or a menu.  Ok, fuck you then.  I won\\'t be going back.in the past 12 months alot of staff turn over. Some of the care givers are very unprofessional, talking to residents like their little children.  \\n Also, the staff do not wear name tags, they should,  communication problems, between family and staff, no writes anything down, creates alot of confusion. \\nAlso when you first arrive the entry is so nice, and so is the sitting atrea with a fireplace, but where the residents spend 24 hours a day, locked down indoors (can not use the back patio, I guess its for \"show\" ??, is very depressing decor and colors and the place smells too.\\n  We will be looking to move our family member out of there if things do not improve soon.\\nIts gone from bad to Worse.  Do Not rely on their literature believing your loved one will have a room with an \"assistance needed\" call button, or anything in the bathrooms. A resident could slip and fall in their private bathroom, and lay helpless for up to Two (2) hours!  Don\\'t chance it, skip this facility, for $6,000. + a month, this is pure corporate Greed at its Worst.Pray you are not in an automobile accident and the party at fault has Erie Insurance. I was driving home from work. As I was making a legal left turn a lady with Erie Insurance ran a red light and smashed into my car. She admitted fault. This was Monday night. It is now Thursday and after many calls Erie Insurance has still NOT provided a rental car. My car is not drivable and was our only means of transportation. As a result, I have missed work and may face disciplinary action up to dismissal. Fortunately, yesterday a coworker drove 30 min out of his way to give me a ride. Erie Insurance, you do not choose to do the right thing.  At this point, we still have no transportation. Why Erie Insurance, why!!!I have been here before over the years and have enjoyed the buffet, but did notice quality reducing with each visit. \\nWow! Talk about a horrible dinner. I had to give this a 1 star because there is no lower choice - if there were I would say - avoid at all costs...more like a - (minus) 10. \\n\\n Went to the Richmond Hill location Sunday evening (27-May-2012 about 7 pm) and tried the buffet - turned out to be the worst food I have ever tasted in my life - and seriously - that is no exaggeration. \\nMost of the food was obviously leftovers from a previous event - perhaps the afternoon buffet. Here is a summary: \\nWhite rice - overcooked, mixed with undercooked rice - so I guess you would think it evens out ;) \\nMade to order dosa (crepe) - pathetic, limp & colourless - for those who have eaten a dosa before, this tasted nothing like the real thing. \\nSambar - passable, but did not taste like any other sambhar I have ever had before :( tasted more like a poor attempt at making India curry for the first time in your life :(( - with scraps of potato, a couple of tiny tomato pieces \\nRasam - passable) \\nPlain vada - overcooked and reheated \\nVada is tamrind sauce - great invention - but for who? vada in sambhar or rasam in the traditional style would have been more than sufficient - but of course - they probably realize that the sambhar here is not actually sambhar, so were forced to look for a way out to make the overcooked reheated vadas edible. \\nDaal - was actually the only thing that was edible and I actually enjoyed it with the overcooked/under cooked rice combo dish. \\nVegetable - some form of proiyal (dry vegetable dish with coconut) - burnt and dried out beyond recognition - it may even have been meat ;) it was that transformed. \\nNow to the curries - \\nButter chicken - an item that should really be left to those who actually know the difference between that and regular chicken curry - what we got was some chicken that was shredded (from stirring it too much while cooking I guess) and this of course must have been made by the same cook who made the sambhar - and turned out to be a cross between tomato soup and Sri Lankan style chicken curry - must have started with one and then changed direction I guess - awful!! \\nFish curry - gravy was fine, hardly an pieces with any meat - tons of tail and head, but meat - scarce - as well the few 1 inch cubes I could find were over cooked - like hard cottage cheese - what a waste of fish. \\nDeserts: Ice creams were fine - payasaam (Indian pudding) was stale and obviously left over. \\n\\n I had decided not to have a before dinner drink - BIG MISTAKE - Should have ordered a couple of Doubles - that would probably have numbed my tongue and at least allowed me to eat something... \\nEnough said I guess - Can someone please post an update IF and WHEN they actually get a good meal at this place!!!For several weeks I tried to start a full corporate membership here and the staff there could give a darn. I\\'d use other words but they are not rated p.g. Never in my life in the service industry have I seen a business held to such low standards. I called several times and left my information and NEVER did I have one call returned. The customers here are treated like a nuisance and don\\'t get me started how the front desk/salesman completely lie to you when signing agreements. I\\'d rate zero stars but they don\\'t let you. Thank the Lord Snap fitness is right across the street.They screwed up our delivery and the only way to get the correct order was to come in to the store.  They said that new people messed up the order... Not a good excuse.  Pizza boxes saturated with grease...very gross.  Also delivered to us in the past, but most recent delivery said they won\\'t anymore.  Pretty piss-poor service...look for other options.Horrible food & service. Have been here several times in past and was great. Will not come back after this experience.I have no idea how this place has so many good ratings. I had super breakfast combo and coffee. The eggs were too runny (ordered over medium). I asked waiter more cook. Sent back my 3 eggs twice finally they cooked my eggs over medium but I lost 1 egg. WHY??? Where is my another egg? I didn\\'t eat any eggs but they charged me full. I payed full for my food but didn\\'t leave tip for waiter. Waiter said to me \"Not my fault\" and \"No tip?\" Why she can ask me tip???  Service and coffee was just horrible. I think they need to be more organized to avoid all the careless mistakes they have been making. Shucks Norm, I won\\'t be back!My wife and I have been customers of this RC Willey for almost 10 years. We\\'ve had floors, appliances, multiple furniture purchases and have an entire home filled with their products. Tonight we walked in and spent 20 minutes looking at dishwashers. Not one single person approached us and we were rather surprised. At first people seemed busy and we were patient so we wandered to clearance where two salespeople were helping one couple and they left clearance without so much as a hello. We wandered back out to the sales floor and found 4 salesman conversing and watching TV and 1 on his phone. We continued browsing and not one single approach, even after eye contact was attempted.  Then a woman holding her dog walked in and a salesman walked right up to her. And that is when we decided to leave. We\\'ve spent a lot of money over the years in your establishment and now we will look elsewhere for our needs. Unacceptable. I certainly hope this is not a reflection of the possible disapproval of our lifestyle. Peace out RC WilleyThere is a girl that works the front (brown girl with light eyes) that just has a terrible attitude.  \\n\\nYou could be very respectful but for some reason this girl just has issues.  She is condescending, the way she speaks is disrespectful, and she screams at customers.  It is strange and awkward\\n\\nI just want to eat some fried chicken without any drama....ill come back to this location when they change up this issue.Completely unprofessional. \\nI tried to solicit a tattoo from Ryan, set an appointment and everything, but never heard back about a design. When I reached out about why he hadn\\'t gotten back to me, he said someone else had told him I had come in and gotten the tattoo done by another person (why would I do that when I specifically wanted him to tattoo me?). He said he could draw something up, but I told him to let me think about it first, because I wasn\\'t super comfortable with a shop that just loses track of serious customers (not saying no yet, just wanted time to consider what happened). He then told ME that I had made HIM uncomfortable and that he was unwilling to tattoo me, after he had failed to get back to me and/or someone at his shop had screwed up. \\nRyan is completely unprofessional and I will be looking elsewhere and telling everyone I know to avoid this entire shop.Sushi did not taste fresh.  And whatever sauce they used on my not-fresh dragon roll almost made me puke.  Service was decent though.  That deserves the one star I am forced to put on here.This place used to be on of my favorite we were there yesterday after going to the club and drinking so everyone asked me where is a good place to eat around 2:30 am so I said el vaporcito is the best \\nWe waited close to 1 hour to have a seat another 45 minutes for our food,when I got my food was cold and I got my tortilla with my check to pay don\\'t know what really happened to this place and don\\'t care not coming backAfter being charged $60 for my $15 co payment I thought it was okay at first they couldn\\'t do a refund so I would just use it up anyways with future appointments I had to get blood work done, Come to find out the dr. I had quit so they had no record of me needing blood work so I would have to make another appointment... I just called to make another appointment and they didn\\'t call me back in 3 hours and didn\\'t answer the phone.. I would totally recommend finding another doctor wait time is terrible and staff turnaround seems to be high.. Now I am sick having to find another doctor.. TERRIBLEI took my husband out to breakfast with my kids this morning. It started out fine, but it then took over 20 minutes to get our food. Everyone else\\'s food came out fine, but my omelette was cold and the cheese inside was 2 pieces of two stale, unmelted pieces of Swiss and American. I showed the waitress the omelette and she just stared me in the face silently as if this kind of food was acceptable to eat. I asked her to take it back and she did. No apologies, no offer to remake it or to replace it with something else. The manager didn\\'t even emerge to apologize. I wasn\\'t expecting a free check, but an acknowledgement of wrong doing would\\'ve been the correct thing to do. Sadly, this is the second chance I\\'ve given this location. I will NEVER be back.I\\'ll be contacting the BBB to report this business because it is blatantly RACIST & I don\\'t on speak racism lightly. Matter of fact, I posted their racist comments in the picture gallery for others to review.  I found this place via Groupon and decided to give it a try. I thought the deal they offered was pretty good and maybe this can be a go to place for me and to bring a few of my friends in the future. I was wrong. The 20 minute detox was ok. The \"70 minute\" massage was ok even though the therapist keep stepping out to drink water and stretch quite loudly. The rooms are not private or remotely sound proof and I was even ok with that.  What was NOT OK was an unspoken minimum $10 tip. I found that out when I opted to give a $5 tip which is my right.  The set/given price is the price, anything extra is at the customer\\'s discretion...you can\\'t force a tip.  The service was ok, not excellent and there was serious confusion due to me opting to give $5. After about 1 minute of me saying \"I want to give $5\" and them pointing at the paper saying \"good equals $10 suggested tip\" they finally got it. It was ok not good but due to the confusion & unnecessary racist remarks I will not be back to this business and would not suggest anyone else go there either. If I could give a rating for zero stars I would.Slowest service ever. The waitress was unattentive. Took food away while I was still eating. My taco was cold. She slammed my plate down when after we asked what was taking so long. Since we waited two hours to get our food. And thirty minutes to get a drink. You\\'d get better service at Taco Bell. Don\\'t bother.We had high expectations, but we\\'re very disappointed. We had both ribs and chicken, and both were way over cooked and dry. The selection of sauces is ok but tastes like they bought it at a grocery store. \\nEverything was what you would expect of a chain. Yuck. We won\\'t be back.the owners brag about experience and knowledge but when you fact check what they\\'re telling you, its wrong. terrible experience, wasted time and money on laser hair removal and all the hair grew back. Luckily i was not burned as some other people i heard about were.Like I don\\'t even know where to begin !!!! We have gone here so many time and was satisfied with everything mind you we have a 4 month baby girl. \\nSo tonight we where going to go see rough night that funny chick flick and yes I had my baby girl with me and they said I couldn\\'t enter because I had a baby like wtf I\\'m a MOMMMMMY like you want me to just leave my baby behind UMM NO and my spouse and I where trying to just have a good night out and they fucked it up. Like it\\'s almost a form of discrimination towards couple who have babies but still wanna have a good night out. Just to let y\\'all know before you decide to go there on a Tuesday date night DAY !!!!!This place is hairy.\\n\\nAbout a year ago, I was mortified when the tuna sandwich I had almost completely consumed had a dark hair attached to it. I kindly went up to the counter to express my dismay and the manager asked me if I wanted \"credit for next time\"? Um, I don\\'t think there will be a next time. I kindly asked for my money back which they did, reluctantly. \\n\\nAbout a week ago, I decided to give them another chance. Hey, hair happens and they have really good salads. So I went and would you believe it? There was ANOTHER HAIR stuck to the hard-boiled egg in my salad!!! Lightning never strikes twice but apparently hair does, at least at this place. \\n\\nI called right away because I just could not believe it had HAPPENED AGAIN. This time they offered to make me a \"new\" salad and quickly ended the call. I came back for the salad, although I didn\\'t even want it at this point. The manager was no where to be found when I returned. I will never go back to Old Station which is unfortunate because other than the hair, their menu was good.Overpriced. Paid for services not requested. Services requested not done.\\nBrought in a pleated skirt to be cleaned. All pleats pressed out.  Send skirt back to be ironed properly, was accused of wearing skirt and taking to another dry cleaner and was charged for a cleaning. Was told to pay extra for pleating. Skirt is ruined. Pass this overpriced place and find a better dry cleaner. \\nIf I could put a half a star, I would.Horrible food. Went here with my gf and everything down to the sausage was disgusting and gross tasting. Hash-browns are extremely undercooked. Low quality foods,cooked like crap. This place used to be some other dump a way long time ago and I remember going there then even and throwing my food out and going across the street to mcdonalds.I thought the store had a good collection of clothes but I did not care for the attitude of the people who work there. I was shopping while they were looking through a box of clothes someone had brought in, making rude comments the entire time. The customer came back in and they said they wanted two items. The customer left and they picked one of the items up and said \"she didn\\'t wear this? Yeah, right.\" I was changing in the dressing room and they were complaining about a customer who asked about their policy in bringing items in and they didn\\'t seem to understand it. One of the workers said the customer must have been \"mentally disabled\" and they all laughed. Then they complained about how their discount was changed and customers get a better deal than they do. (Boo-hoo.) I left without buying anything.Service and food were poor quality. Limp salad and the hottest wings tasted like bbq sauce. Won\\'t be going back. The waitress obviously doesnt like her job.Let me start out with I used to love this store before they merged with Safeway now the store employees are rude and the store is not stocked  prices are not like they use to be and the meat is not the quality it was  I use to drive out of my way to go to this store since I live out west but I will be finding somewhere else to shop and some where else to take my parents shopping at there is nothing that great to deal with rude employees thanks lady in the meat department your company just lost mine and my whole families business that was the last straw!!!!!! Albertsons and Safeway  you need to get it togetherRented from JEK for the Fall of 2016-2017. \\n\\nThey had to come to the apartment multiple times to fix the bath tub, which wasn\\'t draining, and took a very long time to fix it.\\n\\nAside from that, when it was time to move out they deducted more than they should have from my deposit, but since I don\\'t have pictures of what the property was like before, I can\\'t contest the charges they made to me.Awful wait times, their triage/ acuity process is a joke and everyone moves like a sloth. We were treated with anything but respect and dignity. Waiting 4+ hours to be seen, when others came and went for the same exact thing (ankle sprain) is ridiculous.Have been here twice and both times th kids running the place a. Got the order wrong and b. Served us burgers that werent cooked.\\n\\nIn fact, while I was there I saw the staff screw up a little kids ice cream, he asked for chocolate and they gave him vanilla. How do you do that?\\n\\nConsidering the price, the place is a joke. I cant believe the management doesnt get involved. Not only will I not be back but I would literally eat Burger King before I ever returned.\\n\\nConsider yourself warned.Count another one in for the \\'never visit again\\' crowd due to the nasty attitude of Ursula ringing you up.  Their food is normally good, today not so much - overcooked and thrown together.  With more options in the area now, improvement of consistent quality and attitude should be on the forefront of her priorities but clearly it\\'s not.Ordered country fried steak w over medium eggs and hash browns.   The hash browns are not even cooked they are mostly white not crispy at all.  My eggs are over easy ..gross..the white part is runny. The steak is over cooked and the breading is almost burnt. \\n\\nNot good and for almost 10 dollars if rather go to filbertos and get a chorizo burrito.Great ice cream but LITERALLY THE WORST SERVICE you\\'ll ever experience. There\\'s 6 or 7 ppl behind the counter on a weekend evening and all they do is sit around and talk to each other while there\\'s a line out the door. It\\'s comical. I worked 7 years at an ice cream stand as my first job, there is NO REASON for it to take 15 minutes to make a banana split. The owner of this place needs to spend more time in the building. I\\'m sure he/she would clean house. You could hire 7 people off the street that could run this place 100X more efficiently. UNREAL.If I could give them negative stars I would!!!!!! Never again will they get my business and I will make sure everyone and anyone I know will never do business with them. They are the biggest scam artist! I reserved the car for 4 days for a total of about 72.00 dollars, with the estimated fees and taxes my amount was roughly $140.00 - I was excited for what I thought was a great deal...Guess again because after all was said and done and all their \"hidden fees\" my total payment was almost $500 dollars...Nothing at all justifies that amount, nothing!! especially after they give the cars to you barely clean at all - dried up soap and water spots all over the car, the windows were so smeared up and filthy that I washed it myself, and they don\\'t clean out the inside because I found a bottle of hand sanitizer under the seat, Used napkins and toothpicks in the backseat pocket, and needing to be wiped down on the inside.\\n\\nNothing at all will ever justify me using them again cause nothing will justify my cost being $350 more than quoted!!I used to enjoy the ease of ordering from Pizza Care and many of my coworkers began ordering from them, based on my recommendation. Unfortunately neither they nor I will be ordering from them in the future. Today I placed an order during the 11 o\\'clock hour, to be delivered for a lunch meeting at work. Along with the street number, I included the name of the business and the suite number. Once the meeting started I was not available to answer my phone, so I missed the call from the driver. He refused to deliver the food to my suite and instead offered to meet me in the lobby. \\n\\nI requested a refund since my food was not delivered as requested. The company will instead only deliver the food to me at another time of my choosing. I\\'m hoping they\\'ll at least remove the 30+ percent tip I\\'d already added!This is the worst yoga studio in downtown Toronto, for sure. \\n\\nMy friend and I arrived just before a yoga class at this location started (due to the unpredictability of life, we were not able to arrive 15 minutes earlier as recommended on the website). I\\'ve never been treated with such disrespect. At a YOGA STUDIO, nonetheless.\\n\\nThe girl working the front, and her fellow staff members chatting behind her, regarded my friend and I with disdain as we quickly signed waivers before getting ready  for class. I apologized to the girl for being a few minutes late - class was at 7:15, we arrived to the front at 7:13. \\n\\nShe shook her head with disapproval and asked if I was already changed. I nodded yes. She directed me to the lockers and I, now feeling the pressure to rush to my yoga practice, quickly misplaced my token. \\n\\nI rushed back to the desk, asking for a new token, and the girl responded with contempt by shoving a token into my palm saying, \"You know what, you are already so late for your practice you better just go in\". \\n\\nAll I have to say is that it is extremely counter-intuitive for a YOGA STUDIO to disrespect potential clients at the outset of their experience at the studio. Customer service 101: hire front staff that will kindly welcome clients. I entered my yoga practice feeling guilty and upset, like I had disappointed the studio by being a non-ideal client. I\\'ll forever be regretting paying $20 for that drop-in session. \\n\\nThank goodness that the yoga instructor was very understanding of my tardiness - I only wish that the whole studio would embrace that same positive, warm energy. \\n\\nI should add that another girl working at the front grunted at my friend who, not knowing where to return her mat, tried to return the mat to the front desk. The girl angrily said, \"You return that back there\". We didn\\'t even know what to do with that response. Where is \\'back there\\'? \\n\\nHonestly, nothing could keep me there any longer after that comment. \\n\\nIf you like feeling relaxed during your hot yoga practice and interacting with fellow human beings at reception who understand that life gets in the way sometimes, then DO NOT COME TO THIS LOCATION. I will definitely be practicing yoga elsewhere in the future and spreading the news that this studio has horrible customer service.Nice people.  Terrible TERRIBLE service. I left a simple zipper repair that they told me it would take two days at most. I left the samples apple repair that they told me would take 2 days at most. \\nI called 4 days later, and my wingsuit was not yet done. I told them I would be out of town for one week, and would like to pick it up when I returned.\\nI called on my return, and left a message for them to call me back.\\nNo call came.\\n\\nThree days later, I stopped by the store, to pick up my wing suit that should have been done 2 weeks before \\n it still wasn\\'t done.\\n\\nIt was a simple zipper repair, a single 19 inch zipper the needed to be replaced. Nothing more. It was something up had done many times another shops around the country. Usually, it takes a day to 2 days to get it done. This couldn\\'t do it in 2 weeks. Terribly disappointed as I have several sport sewing needs.\\n\\nMost of all, I was disappointed that my weekend plans were destroyed.Only the location on 4th AND \"it\\'s not Starbucks\" is what most likely keeps the Purple \"perking\".\\n\\nService and the care factor was not very high here on 02/19th at about 09:45am.Me and my group of 3 girls were approached yesterday by a club promoter for encore beach club, we got a confirmation text and went to see Major Lazer. When we approached the security line the bouncer didn\\'t believe that my friend was 21... He literally questioned her height, asked her what her middle name was, what her sign was, what her high school graduation year was, and when my other friend and I said for her to show that she even had credit/debit cards in her name he said that didn\\'t even matter (mind you she just turned 25)...and kicked us out... We asked to get a second opinion and we were denied, also the guy was extremely rude when he didn\\'t need to be. Needless to say we were very frustrated and offended. I feel that there should be a rule about getting a second opinion on an ID, and management available to speak to regarding an employee. They were very unprofessional and lost out on money that we would have spent on while there.CUSTOMER BEWARE Saw ad for $7.77 oil chance with coupon, typical bait and switch. Manager Carlos immediately tried the bait and switch even though I was told different on the phone but that is not the big part of it.  When I asked to many questions as to why tell me one thing on the phone and another when I arrived he said get out. When I left as I was walking to my car I was bullied by several employees pushed and threatened I called Metro Police (event # LLV160518001189) When Metro wanted to see survelence camera tape they would not show saying they were not working, the truth they did not want evidence of assault.   THESE PEOPLE ARE BAD BUSINESS BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE.  With so many auto repair places in Las Vegas please do not support bad business.  This was a customer that went from an ad that was threatened as I was leaving.  Carlos and staff can not be trusted.I\\'m done with this place. I\\'ve been here before several times and many times when I have guest visit me, I\\'ll take them here or recommend people here. Today I arrived with family who are visiting us and decided to grab a bite to eat. It was 4:40pm and as we arrived, this  man (later found out is a manager) approached us and with a stern voice told us \" you have 5 min to order because the kitchen will close \". What kind of crap is that?! He was practically telling us to turn around and leave. Ive worked I this industry for many years and understand that the staff wants to go home, but you still should accommodate guests as best as you can. I\\'ve had way better customer service the times I\\'ve been here before. This town is growing, as far as places to eat. I\\'m taking my business elsewhere and will not recommend this place again. Like I said, many other places to go and eat.Why did I give this place one star...\\n\\na. I ordered a medium rare cause I\\'m low on iron (yay pregnancy) it came out medium..barely any pink. The man ordered medium and it was medium well so it wasn\\'t a mistake. \\nb. chili was so dry and lackluster\\nc. $30 bucks for to subpar burgers, fries and a shake\\n\\nYou should try\\nthe bacon milkshake, which does taste like apple jacks\\nthe spicy pickles from the pickle bar.This place is awful! When my boyfriend and I  sat down it took our server 15 mins just to greet us(meanwhile we were sitting right in front of the kitchen and could see that she was just taking her sweet time) then took another 15 mins just to get salad and breadsticks on our table. Our server never came and checked on us to see how we were doing once we got our food (our food wasn\\'t very good) or if we needed anything! I had to be the one to flag her down and get something. I also heard her talking to her manager and she only had 2 tables!!! Us and the table next to us and basically ignored us the whole time. I don\\'t know if she was busy or stressed but if that was the case she shouldn\\'t be working there! I will never be back to this location! So sad!I went yesterday and even though the food prices are ridiculous, the bagels were great. Went back today to get some bagels for Home. Completely different Bagel, store bought not made in house. Reminded me of a grocery store bagel. Who does that?? Real classy to offer your customers such an inferior product. By the way, yesterday when I went for breakfast they only had plain and poppy. Was told the baker can\\'t keep up. Never will go back again. This place was not ready to open, and now they have lost me, and it looks like a bunch of others from ever going back.Saw this pharmacy was near by and needed a prescription filled. A CVS PHARMACY on a Saturday should be open, right?! Wrong! The pharmacy closes at 6 on Saturday. I asked the cashier who was sitting on her cell phone for assistance. Shouldn\\'t have even bothered.It is very sad to know that you close before your posted closing times on Sundays. We came in just before 8:00 on Sunday night. Two young men told us that they were already closed. I think they just wanted to go home early. I\\'m a loyal customer and being pregnant I was really craving a salad. I\\'ll think twice before returning to this location.Our server was wonderful throughout the night and so was the food & atmosphere. However, we were half way through our food and our bay only had 5 minutes left and our server mentioned lengthening our time (we already did once) and we passed because we just wanted to finish our food and leave. We spent $100 at the bar and our bill was $270 at our table. This man, Richard, came out asking us to move to the \"free\" section mid bite. That was probably the most insulting thing he said as if we didn\\'t just spend $370 before a tip. He kept going on and on about the \"policy\" etc. we would have understood if it was 8pm on a Friday or Saturday and it was packed with a wait but it was 10pm on a Tuesday and there were all free bays in sight. My family is in town visiting me and we were trying to enjoy each other\\'s company. We are reasonable and if we planned on staying to \"party\" we surely would have moved. Our family owns restaurants in PA so we know customer service and understand occupying servers tables. Richard should have came over, said hello, thanked us for coming and made the bay idle long enough for us to finish our meal. He should have given her a table out of her section to make up for us staying there (which idk what there would have been to make up for.. a $55 tip..?) and just confirmed we weren\\'t there to party. I have never experienced anything like this in my life and is a sure way to keep people away from Top Golf. Such a disappointment.Every time I go to Boston Pizza, I know something is going to go wrong. In this case, everything went wrong. \\n\\nCame here for a reserved party of 25 and the table wasn\\'t ready on time, despite the empty restaurant. The AC was off and the slushee machines were down, mind you it was 30 degrees outside so it\\'s kind of a big deal when all 25 of us are sticking to our seats from sweating. Our waiter, having been told the bills would be separate, not only messed up our orders, but also lost track of who ordered what without telling us or asking for clarification - he literally smacked a solo bill at the end of the night and told us he lost track halfway through the night so he just combined it all. When the food got to us, it was cold Getting drinks was a hassle as well. We ordered beers and an hour later was told they ran out. When we wanted water, we had to ask three different servers until we finally got it. If it was a busy night, this would all be more understandable but it was so dead in that restaurant. \\n\\nThe best is when we talked to the manager about all this, she was deflecting the blame and yelling at us back. I\\'m sorry we brought you a party, it definitely won\\'t happen again.Why can\\'t I give zero stars?\\nThis place is horrible. We rented a vehicle through them online and I regret it. I should\\'ve known better when I saw the looks on the faces of their  \\'staff\\' at the desk. They clearly did not care about their customers, or probably anything else for that matter.  We are Nevada residents, and they add undisclosed \\'locals\\' fees to your rental and then argue with you about it. (These fees were not disclosed anywhere when we made our reservation.) The manager is especially awful and told me point blank that they hate renting to Nevada residents.  He followed me out the door yelling at me and threatening me.  If you don\\'t want to deal with someone shady- stay away from this place.Every time I enter this store and associate is a total jerk. No customer service or respect for shoppers. Terrible place to shop. Do not go here.They are Still the worst probably in the whole US. Will never return or recommend, terrible service. Somehow they manage to stay ahead of the poor innocent people of. SS or SSI. Do your research before you step into this unprofessional and unethical place.  Everything  they get away with is wrong.I called and made an apointment to go in to have my oil changed and to check out a noise coming from the back of my truck.10 mins before schedueled time I arrived and went to the desk to check in. Was greated by a very rude man who went on to tell me he has too many cars and I am going to have to wait hours. Then he proceeded to look in the computer to see my sheduled apointment and tells me there is nothing he can do about it. Get it together..and if there is an issue try not being rude to your customers..very unprofessional and they have lost me as a customer. Very unsatisfied.Please Verrado ground Control owners... Go into your locations and see what\\'s going on!! Food is bland !! Service is not up to par !! We have only 2 other places to eat in Verrado so your making $$ because of that reason and that reason only? Do you want to be a pub that serves beer and semi good martinis or a great gastro-pub that serves both great food and drinks? We as Verrado residents need you to care about quality and our loyalty! As of today I can\\'t enter your establishment and eat a simple Quesadilla thats so easy to make taste good but your cooks(I won\\'t say chef ) destroy it !! Really , is this what you want in Verrado ??! you need better management or owners need to wake up!! And smell the coffee next door!! Listen to your reviewsIf you go there dont let the male hairdresser touch your hair. Gonna be wearing a hat for the next month because of him.First and LAST visit. With just one person ahead of me, my visit to pick up our order took FIFTEEN MINUTES. The employee was painfully slow and scattered. To add insult to injury, once they finally located my items, they said I owed more $$ because they miscounted, and THEN I had to ask more than once to see a receipt as proof. Seriously? I don\\'t think it\\'s unreasonable to ask to see it in writing. They just wanted me to take their word for it. Meanwhile, the line is backing up out the door. On top of all this ridiculousness, I\\'m pouring sweat because the place has no air conditioning and it\\'s freaking August with 104 temps! The owners should be absolutely ashamed of themselves expecting workers to slave away in a hot and humid shop like this! The fans only blow the hot air around and make both the employees and the customers cranky and hot! So on reflection, while I didn\\'t exactly get the best service, I\\'m not sure I could do my best in these working conditions either! Arizona may be an at will state, and employers can certainly do what they want, but I won\\'t give any more business to these jerks. Hopefully their employees find better jobs with people who actually care about them.Too bad they don\\'t give 1/2 star options.\\nThis place was the WORST hotel I have ever stayed at.  We payed over $90 a night for a non smoking room and when we got there, they put us in a room that had more smoke than a Las Vegas Casino.  I was travelling with 2 young asthmatic kids and called down to the office where i was rudely offered my money back.  Where was I going to go at 7pm during Spring Training?  She offered an Ozone machine but we would have to leave for 1 hour while it worked.  While I spoke to my husband about our options, she rudely called back to tell me not to use the bathroom or sit on the bed so she could re rent it if we left.  REALLY LADY????\\nNow that\\'s great customer service...NOT.  Don\\'t offer me solutions to our problem just worry about getting MONEY for this crappy room.  Will not EVER stay in this hotel and not really sure if I want to try any other in this line of hotel/motels.Horrible experience. First of all, they don\\'t return calls or emails. They should be going out of their way to make sure my documents are in order. I\\'m not eligible for an FHA mortgage until 17 September 2016, but I sent all the required documentation requested by Lane Dod at Academy Mortgage. I tried to have someone else take over, but never received a call back, once again. I called the Gilbert office, and explained my situation, and the receptionist said she would have the manager call me back. It has been over a week, and still no call. Should I have to beg for service? The only time I received a call back from Lane, was when I asked his office to replace him with someone else. He called and became nasty, and even said \"have a nice...\", but he hung up on himself before he finished his sentence. About six weeks ago, he said he was going to talk to his supervisor about a document I had submitted, but I never heard back from him. It\\'s simple: if you say you\\'re going to do something, do it. \\n\\nThis is what happens when you deal with people who have mediocre educations, and an inability to do their jobs efficiently. Furthermore, Lane Dod has to be in his late 70\\'s, and needs to retire, because he doesn\\'t have the patience or the fortitude for customer service. \\n\\nI\\'m now working with a new mortgage company, and the service is personable, professional, prompt, thorough, and gives me peace of mind. They treat me like family, and I like that my agent gives me updates on a regular basis. Also, this mortgage company is incredibly resourceful. \\n\\nLane Dod does the bare minimum, and didn\\'t even tell me that I could use a cosigner. As a result, I\\'ve wasted five months of my time with Academy Mortgage. I have a credit score that is 700, but my parents both have a credit score of 800+, and even my sisters offered to cosign. No thanks to Academy Mortgage, I will be moving into a brand new house at the end of the month.Just ordered a Fuji apple chicken salad only to find out once I got home they forgot the chicken...annoyingWorst Outback I\\'ve been too. First time they gave away my order yo wrong client at curbside takeaway. The second time they were understaffed for traffic, provided incorrect rate times and served all the customers first who walked in after I pulled up. What a way to spend a Friday watch as they walk away with your card that\\'s waiting for you to sign after waiting 10 minutes to be acknowledged only to be told it might have been faster if I went in and didn\\'t participate in their offering of curb side takeaway. Go to the Outback on Chandler Blvd and 54th street. Better service all around. Shame on me for going back a second time to this location. Food was not worth the wait.Use caution with this location----they sold me a clearly used product as new--I didn\\'t detect this until I got home---they agreed to replace---however in my opinion this is a deceptive and innapropriate business practice.   I usually shop at the Tatum store--where I have never had a problem before---so for me I am only going to Tatum from now on.Horrible food, worse music, inattentive staff and overpriced drinks. No wonder they closed.Sales person is telling me that it\\'s unlimited data unlimited everything and that the data won\\'t slow down that there\\'s no limit.  I was told a different thing at a different location.You know that cool Mini you ordered? You are getting a Hyundai instead. Avoid Sixt. \\n\\nEmployees are very nice but it\\'s under staffed and the shuttle van runs late.\\n\\nYou\\'re going to do better to go to a major rental car company that is across from baggage claim.The service as well as the manager in this establishment are terrible..waited over and hour for our food and watched 4 other tables who ordered after us get there food first yet the waitress blamed the time on the kitchen staff..the manager was not helpful at  all was very ignorant wouldn\\'t come back to this place if it was offering free foodThis use to be my favorite place but the food tonight was horrible. I don\\'t know if they have new chefs but everything me and my friend ate was extremely bland just no flavor at all. Never coming back.Awfull service..don\\'t go here...the guy kept my coupon to give me a discount on my smog check, and when the car failed its smog bec I just had the battery jumped , refused to give it back and charged me $10 for failing and no free retest..DO NOT GO HERE unless you want to lose your money and fail your smog.One of the worst magic shows I\\'ve ever seen. Of course, what can you expect from an afternoon show? Maybe it was just my angle, but I swear I saw all the wires and the people \"disappearing\" walking in/out behind every trick. They need to work a little harder on the misdirection cause it didn\\'t work for me.This realtor only gets 1 star and that is only because the online photos were very good. Selling a home is always stressful , our personal situation add tho this stress and you hire a realtor to help you through that process. We interviewed 3 different brokers and selected Nate and one of the reasons was that he lived in the community. This was the worst experience we have ever had selling a home. We have sold 4 homes over our lives. \\n\\nGetting feedback from Nate and his team was like pulling teeth and all we heard was constant excuses about how other realtors don\\'t always provide feedback on showings. Every time there was an interested buyer it felt like we were doing more follow-up to find out their interest than our realtor. \\n\\nThis realtor had the nerve to tell us that the reason our home was not getting offers was that we picked a lot in a poor location and after he sold his $1,000,000 plus listing he would have to focus on our property.What a disappointment! I\\'m not feeling well and was craving some Phó. My lovely significant other ordered us some Phó through UberEats. After waiting close to 50 minutes it arrives! Yay...waiting with anticipation! Was very much looking forward to having it. Opened the bag...the disappointment begins! There was not much meat. The soup was barely hot. Barely much  vegetables with it and they charge you for it...granted it\\'s only a $1 but the fact that they charge you for it, they shouldn\\'t stinged you with sides! I specifically notated on the note that I want 3 hoisin packages because I love them along with some schrricha sauce...instead they gave me 1 pack of mixed hoisin and schriccha....it wasn\\'t even full it was a smidgen mixed of the sauce is all they could spare me! Seriously?! Did you guys run out too? I wouldn\\'t have bothered notating how much I love both hoisin & schrricha sauce if I had some at my house to spare! Nevertheless it was a very disappointing dinner.I\\'ve been coming here for a few years, but won\\'t be any more. The food and service only gets worse. I\\'ve had servers spill things on me and not even apologize. Most of the food is pre-cooked or made. It\\'s basically the taco-bell equivalent of Thai food. You\\'re better off making it yourself. \\nAnd even if you were willing to stay for the mediocre food because it might be easier than cooking at home, the staff and service aren\\'t worth it. They\\'re rude, not accommodating, and good luck getting their attention.Okay this is serious! I don\\'t ever give bad reviews but feel that I\\'ve had enough of this narcissistic pizza eatery. So let\\'s talk food yes the pizza is good no doubt! Wood fired pizza is amazing but it\\'s just that anywhere, but that\\'s all it is.  Now they don\\'t take reservations and your entire party needs to be present if you want your table. Yesterday I was told it was only half your party and that they were \"reserving spots\" at the bar. So they change their rules when they see fit, which is their right but it\\'s my right not to eat there. They are unapologetic and slightly rude like a hot cheerleader who gets hit on constantly. Here is the kicker!! They told us to give them our cell phone number and go to another restaurant as we weren\\'t allowed to wait in the their lobby. I started to laugh and told them if I go to another restaurant I am eating there with all due respect. The manager than came to speak with us and even though there were people behind us waiting we were told to wait next door. In the end I may just invest a few thousand dollars and help the business next door install a pizza oven so they can than welcome guests properly. Yes this place is popular but their prices are ridiculous when u really see what you get for the amount of food you receive the value just isn\\'t there. I think it\\'s time this place realized that customers are what\\'s important. Ask not what your customer can do for you rather ask what you can do for your customer. Please join me in selecting another newer and friendlier place to eat next time you head out to spend your hard earned money. Thanks for reading!My husband and I just moved here due to him being stationed at Luke AFB. Roadhouse is a big deal and an amazing restaurant back in our hometown in Ohio, so we thought we\\'d check it out here. The first time we went, his medium steak came out rare and fatty, and my medium well was complete charcoal. The cheese fries were cold and they put cold shredded cheese over top (usually supposed to be melted over the fries??). They offered a free onion for next time. Second time we went, the server took over 10 minutes for our drinks, we waited almost a half hour for our salads (which came out with our steaks?), and the medium well steak came out bloody. After having to sit for awhile because our server never checked on us, I sent it back to cook a little longer, and it came out with no mushrooms or onions that I previously ordered. Then when we requested the check, we asked if military discount was offered. Our server told us no because we had a free app from our previous visit. This place can\\'t cook steaks properly and the service sucked both times. Sadly, we will not be returning to a restaurant we have always loved.I have now lived here for three months. Sadly, things have not improved at all. The internet barely works,and when it is working, it\\'s about the same speed as a dial-up internet connection. Too slow to stream any movies and even surfing the web is a hassle. No wifi available in the bedrooms at all. Internet completely goes out about once a week and when I call the office to ask about the internet not working, they just give me a 1-800 number to call that goes to some remote tech company that is always \"closed\". \\n\\nThe DirecTV service also frequently stops working. It\\'s currently been out of service for a week now and there are no updates on it being fixed any time soon. So the service charges you pay for internet and cable here are a giant waste of money. \\n\\nThe complex is currently being remodeled. This weekend, from 8 am-6 pm, workers were hammering and stomping on the roof. It got so loud that I had to leave. If you need to repair the roof, maybe do it during the week when people aren\\'t home trying to relax?! \\n\\nSome of the other tenants here are great, but there are some really sketchy people here as well. Loud rap music is blasted all weekend, every weekend. Today I tried to lay out by the pool but had to leave because of all the uncomfortable comments made by the skeezy drunk men who live near the pool. Counting down the days until my lease ends.This place fucking sucks, it\\'s so god damn hot and it\\'s suppose to be winter, i could feel myself sweat in this place. They should fix the A/C immediately. Second off the employees suck at giving wait times, they said 25-30 mins and it took over a hour. \\nOn top of everything else the staff was horribleVery very poor customer service at the front desk when we checked in. Then my family and I overheard the girls talking about us after we left. If it wasn\\'t New Years in Las Vegas we would have moved hotels. And we are gold members, we have been going to these hotels for many years. Hopefully these girls will get updated training.Expect a long wait. I waited about 2 hours just to be seen. Bring a book or laptop or sleeping bag!  The Waiting room was full of people who were restless (a few even sleeping) because they\\'d been waiting for so long.  Also, when standing at the window to ask a question, it seems they purposely turn their backs or heads so as not to appear to see you so they don\\'t have to acknowledge you. 4 people milling about the office and over 7 minutes for them to acknowledge me standing there. Only Good thing is, parking is easy and convenient.I received a book of coupons as a gift so I went today for a \"free\" car wash - and that is what it was worth. If I hadn\\'t had another appointment I would have gone back and made them do it over. Glass was still dirty, open the passenger door and the sill still had mud, the wheel wells are filthy and they couldn\\'t even put the floor mats back down correctly. I will avoid this place until they get some competent management.I have been to this location twice, they have screwed up my order twice! the food is awful & the prices ridiculous!! Fish & chips missus the chips since they neglected to put them in the order, I ordered the cheese dip that was also missing, butter burger & chili for twenty dollars! I will not return!I purchased Crowd Savings coupons for this establishment. But when I went there, they said they will not honor my coupon, even though it expires after over 3 months. Seems like they have a dispute with Crowd Savings.\\n\\nBut I should not have to pay for the dispute they have. Really, really disappointed.I originally fired the first company that my insurance recommended. Then I chose evds since they claimed to be able to complete my small roof repair and drywall damage in 3 days. It\\'s had been 3 months and my relays are shoddy and have needed to be redone multiple times. I would never recommend them to anyone. I\\'m still waiting for out to be complete.\\n\\nI had to escalate it to a supervisor to even get on the schedule after the initial appointment. It had been a nightmare and my contract for the sale of my house is on hold due to their shoddy work. Anytime we had an appointment I had to remind them of it. The seem to poor small jobs at the bottom of the priority list.Here\\'s the problem: This is in a DICEY neighborhood, right at the edge of a BAD neighborhood. Two friends of mine were ABDUCTED AT GUNPOINT from this \"lovely patio\" about a month ago. Look it up in the AZ Republic if you don\\'t believe me. One managed to escape being driven down a dark alley (for what purpose??) after being forced to empty her bank account, and managed to run to a store where they called the police, who rescued her friend. Ladies, I would say do not sit on this patio alone after nightfall. BTW, the owners avoided calling the girls back and there was not so much as an \"are they ok\" when their sister called to let them know there had been a problem. they were worried they might ask for something, apparently. Nice!I too bought the 3 Microdermabrasion Groupon...I give it 1 star because the staff are friendly enough- Though I have to agree that the tech who does the treatment gives way more dirty laundry about her boss than anyone should hear...I don\\'t mind chit chat but she really bashes the Drs who own the place ...As for the treatment- it was ok- but not great and they do try to get you to buy extra treatments for your face...I paid an extra $50 to have a spot removed and it didn\\'t work...when I came on my 3rd visit I paid another $25 and she said sometimes it takes several treatments...that information to me sounds like a scam...overpricing items and telling people they may have to do it numerous times is wrong...I wouldn\\'t recommend it- I also think it\\'s tacky for a Drs office to ask for tips!! Are you kidding??! Your stuff is already overpriced and it\\'s weird to ask! I gave a small tip because I thought it was strange they ask but they even post a sign asking for them!! The Dr does face lifts...Microdermabrasion isn\\'t even his thing and it\\'s clear he doesn\\'t put money into that so I\\'m not sure I even understand why they have the groupon! I had already purchased the 3 so I wanted to finish them.I should\\'ve gone with my gut instinct and never took my kids to a daycare where they spelled kids with a Z.  Kidz kidz kidz was pretty much our only option when la petite stopped bussing and accepting school age students.  The initial tour was fantastic! They had dedicated rooms for school age to do homework after school and the facility seemed very well laid out. Summer went somewhat smoothly. We immediately noticed kids were grouped into age groupings that were rather broad and our 6 year old seemed to be with our 3 year old, but they said it was due to low teachers. Our biggest frustration was that the school opens at 6:30 am but yet teachers don\\'t arrive until 6:30 am. This leaves parents standing around for several minutes waiting for teachers to set up. I tried to speak with them about it, but they dismissed me. Once school started, they lost all control.  On the first day when I came to pick them up, I stopped at the front desk and asked if they were back yet as I knew I was early. The director said absolutely they were back. I went back, got my daughter, but couldn\\'t find my son.  That\\'s when the director comes running back yelling my name saying my son actually was not back yet, but was just pulling up. She said, \"another blonde boy walked in so she had marked my son as here. The bus had pulled in a bit later because they had to go back for a child.\"  Only when I got in the car did I realize the gravity of what she said. She had marked my child present when he was not.  We should have pulled them then, but chalked it off to first day issues.  Then, there was the time that the director forgot to run the autopay and ran everyone\\'s cards hours late, overcharging us with late fees for her mistake.  She did refund it back but not for a full week.   This last week, while at dinner, our son informed us he was being bussed to school in a teachers vehicle rather than the bus because it broke down. This happened on multiple occasions and the school failed to inform us. When we asked them about it they say \"oh sorry we told some parents, we must have forgotten to tell you.\"  He was placed in a teachers car without a car seat (he\\'s 6 and tiny) and they haven\\'t even apologized.  They had a second bus, but chose to put the kids in cars instead.   We have asked multiple times for an apology but they haven\\'t even called us once.  This school is a joke. The leadership (ms. Robyn) is poor at best. She is more interested in being a friend to her staff than doing her job and being a boss.  There are some good teachers, but the morning teacher is sour and rude.  Ms. Chelsea is lazy.  I could go on and on with the problems with this school.  Plainly put, they endangered our child and refuse to even speak to us about it because they don\\'t care.  DO NOT Take your kids here. It\\'s only a matter of time before they are named in another high profile lawsuit. (Check out the southern highlands location where they left a kid outside for 40 minutes). Also don\\'t believe the good reviews. Check out what is posted at the entry.  They are enticing people to leave good reviews by offering a chance for reduced tuition.Who owns this place?! Seriously I would like to know... I can not believe they have 4 stars honestly. Ice cream I will say is good but man somebody needs to get new employees... the girls who work there are miserable every time we come and each time we thought hmm maybe they are having a bad day... nope it is ridiculous! And 75 cents for extra Toppings that supposedly they had put in but were not there? And then you are bothering them to come order! One came up to window and my husband had to say hey how are you and we got a stern \"what would you like?\" Not good how are you?!?? Like a normal decent person! Sheesh!We didn\\'t order the sushi because my wife is pregnant. I ordered the Nabe Udon which had all the ingredients and was served boiling hot, but it was too salty to eat. Even the noodles got brown from the amount of soy sause they put in it. The Don Kasu dinner was crispy but the batter didn\\'t stick to the meat. The server said she would tell the manager who never came by, but we did get some dirty looks from the workers and nothing was said or done for us. Don\\'t order udon or donkasu if you know what those dishes are suppose to taste like.Overpriced food that is impossible to order.  The lines are confusing but the prices are high for a hand full of ingredients. Don\\'t know why this place is rated so high, but I know I\\'m not coming back especially since Cafe Rio is so close. There I can get a lot more, better tasting and at better prices.Ok.\\n\\nSo I\\'ve been wanting to try out this salon for a while. I am still on the hunt for the best brazillian in Toronto. I went online and liked the funny casual approach to their marketing so I tried to book an appointment online.\\n\\nNow, \\nI don\\'t have a credit card. Don\\'t want one. Never have. And I\\'m not getting one any time soon. \\n\\nIn the online appointment booking feature you need a credit card to secure your appointment. As I\\'ve just mentioned. I don\\'t have one. So I called them directly for an appointment. The woman on the phone said that it was part of their cancellation policy to get a credit card number and secure the amount for services in order to book an appointment. And since I didn\\'t have one I would need to come into their store and buy a gift card for the value of my service. So basically they insist that you pay for your service before those services have been rendered. And if you don\\'t, they don\\'t want your business. \\n\\nAre you kidding me? I understand a company trying to ensure that their appointments are kept and that they are bringing in money. That\\'s fine. But this is pretty extreme and seems a bit dishonest. I need to leave and go to the salon and buy a $65 gift card for myself just so I can book an appointment for a wax and an eyelash tint? No. Not going to happen. If their services are as good as they boast, I could have potentially been a frequent and loyal customer. But I don\\'t make it a habit of just handing companies money when all I\\'ve done is speak with someone briefly on the phone.  \\n\\nThis place is lame and I\\'m taking my business elsewhere.This review is for the service. One word, slow. Had to ask 5 times to get extra small plates. Water had to ask mutuel time before refill. Need more staff.As a follow up to my previous post about the disappointing customer service at Hilton, the dissatisfaction continues. Hilton has been \"playing\" with my bank account by charging and reversing several times and finally charging it. This is in direct conflict with a statement on their key cards that you stay happy or stay free (or something to that effect). I did not set out to receive a free stay, but after their continued dipping into my account, I believe they should follow their policy.How about NO STAR?!? That\\'s how upset/disappointed I am! \\n\\nI\\'ve been bringing our two female French Bulldog puppies (they are sisters) since they were 8 weeks old. They have been to the veterinarian side and the boarding side. (Prior to this experience, I thought they were great) Clean facility, friendly and knowledgeable staff, I felt very comfortable bring our puppies here. That all changed on May 20, 2017. \\n\\nI\\'m very disappointed, hurt and mad. I don\\'t want other animals and animal owners to be treated poorly. So I believe I am doing the right thing by posting this review. \\n\\nThe incident took place while my Husband and I were on our 10 year wedding anniversary trip in Hawaii where we were renewing our wedding vows. On May 20, 2017, On our special day,  my husband and I were in a massage. After our massage apt, I came out with a very long voicemail left by Dr. Gibson that was 2 mins long. (Which under the circumstances of what I\\'m about to explain happened, I don\\'t think a voicemail was appropriate regarding the details should have been left, but rather wait till I called back to explain. Immediately I panicked, which I\\'m sure would be any animal owner would. \\n\\nWhen we left our puppies in Boca Parks Animal Hospitals care, they were going to be spayed and we were assured they would be very well taken care of and closely monitored while in boarding. So, I immediately thought something happened regarding their surgery! When I listened to the message, I gasped! My husband asked what had happened? I immediately called Boca Park as soon as I got the message! I was so worried about our puppies! I responded to by husband by a panic yell that Boca Park left me a message saying the puppies ate all their medicine & they had to pump their stomaches!!! We were both in disbelief! \\n\\nDr. Gibson got on the phone and I could tell she was uncomfortable and it seemed like she wanted to rush me off the phone. She kept talking very quickly and really left me uncomfortable, in disbelief and in shock!. She assured me that they are now Ok, but they had jumped up inside their mini suite and ate all of their medication. I said our puppies jumped up and got their medication? How is that possible?? She said in the suites they have a ledge were they keep all the dogs belongings and it was on the shelf and they jumped up and knocked it down and consumed all their medication! She had to call poison control for them to advise her what to do!!! Are you kidding me?? (When they are left home alone they are left in a play pen that leads to the side of the house with a dog run! They never have ever jumped over it!) So how in the heck did they jump up and get their medicine is beyond belief! They are little 12lb frenchies! She explained because this happened with our puppies, they have now changed their policies and procedures and the owner was informed! She said they they caught it very quickly and wanted us to know that they pumped their stomaches to get all the medication out. Now mind you this was right after their spay surgery!! My poor puppies!!!! To think they went into surgery and the next day their poor stomachs were pumped!!! I felt so awful!! And there was nothing we could do about it! \\n\\nAs previously stated, It was the day of our 10 year anniversary and we were renewing our Vows, we had to deal with the situation later. My husband called the next day to get clarification and more details on the situation, as he too was in disbelief and wanted to hear it from himself.  He spoke with Dr. Gibson and she told my husband \"if your wife listened to her voicemail, she would know that we offered to compensate their boarding stay with us and medication.\" I thought to myself, Did I miss that mist all the other information she had left me? Clearly I\\'d remember that!! My husband and I listen to my voicemail and that was never mentioned!!! As that was enough? Comping us for their stay? Seriously? She also told my husband there could be complications with their GI in the future but it\\'s hard to say and that Boca Park Animal hospital will also cover any GI problems for up to 6 months. When we returned from our trip May 27 My husband picked up our puppies we had a bill for over $1,000 which for the spay we were quoted $380 each. My husband was told he had to pay the bill (It was a Saturday) and the receptionist at the front had no authority to adjust charges and he had to come back or call to address the issue. My husband said I just wanted to get our puppies & out of there! So he paid the bill and left. I asked my husband to get a copy saying they will take responsibility and cover anything wrong with them should anything arise. The receptionist said in the computer it was only noted they will cover for 30 days!!! So very disappointing! \\n\\nNever in my life have I been so afraid of an animals life and in the care of professionals!!!!! I would NEVER RECOMMEND Boca Park Animal Hospital unless you want to worry about your pets!I went for the doubles and I was totally disappointed. I did try other  food items and found that the seasoning was just what it should be. The place is great for those who are not from Trinidad so they may not realize that some seasoning has been omitted.They received one star from me because you have to give a rating... zero would have been my choice.  The chicken was way overcooked and the nachos were bland. the cheese wasn\\'t properly melted, the pico de gallo and guacamole had no flavor.  The burnt, boring, and overpriced food was only surpassed by the really bad service.  Our server was friendly enough, and having been in food service in the past, I\\'m pretty patient; however, she never returned to the table to check on our drinks or ask how the food was because we would have sent the chicken back.  And if any of the other servers are around don\\'t bother asking for their assistance, and  don\\'t even try to get the attention of a bus boy - who may just be cleaning the next table over.  \\n\\nAfter waiting a long while for our server to return so that my daughter could get a refill on her soda, she asked another server, who was just standing around chatting up another server.  Her response:  \"Would you like me to get your waitress?\"  Um, no, I\\'d like anyone to get me refill on a simple little soda...apparently too much to ask.  I know this is an airport restaurant, and Las Vegas of all airports, but c\\'mon!?  \\n\\nThe bad food and \"you\\'re not my table\" attitude was crazy.  On our return flight via Las Vegas, we bought Sbarro\\'s.   The food was as we expected from Sbarro\\'s, yet still better than Sammy\\'s, for a lot less money, and with friendlier service.If you want to go somewhere with amazing service, good food & owners who scream at their employees, this is the spot for you. I\\'ve given this place more than a couple chances & although I actually enjoy the food, I couldn\\'t in good conscious continue to give my money to owners who feel like they can scream at their employees in front of customers. The owners seem to be a couple, I\\'ve seen the male owner completely berate a female bartender to the point of tears once and actually heard (!) the couple screaming at each other on a separate occasion when I was seated near the kitchen. It\\'s sad because the rest of the staff are always so kind & helpful, I don\\'t know how they put up with their bosses. I can\\'t give my money to bad people no matter how good the food is.One star for the ambiance, but don\\'t even bother ordering anything off their drink menu. It\\'s a Tuesday night and they\\'re literally out of everything. The server listed way too many drinks they were out of, and when we made a comment, she said this was better than any of the other nights. Then she threw out a comment saying they haven\\'t been carrying most of the drinks on the menu. Again, it\\'s a Tuesday night. I suggest they re-print their menu with the drinks they actually do have, and spell \"Dos Equis Ambar\" correctly. Also, my friend ordered a Dierks Dram, hence their name, and the server came back saying they were not able to make that because they\\'re out of bourbon. As I\\'m typing this, bartender came by and we thought he was gonna say they were out of another drink, but instead said their French 75 has a strong whiskey taste so he wanted to make sure \"the drink wasn\\'t for a girl.\" French 75 does not have whiskey in it and how offensive was that comment?!!! How is this place open?!???Arrived at the rental car shuttle pick up at LAs Vegas McCarran Airport around 12:30am. ACE car rental closes at 1am and is supposed to have a shuttle for pick up every 15 minutes. Waited for a frustrated 30 minutes and decided to just take my business elsewhere. We\\'ve tried calling several times well in advance of arriving at the pick-up location. There is no one there to answer the calls even during their supposedly open hours. Completely unprofessional business. I will NEVER even consider doing business with ACE again and will make sure to discourage others to do so as well. \\n\\nThere was another customer who waited for an hour for the shuttle. The airport workers said this is a common occurrence for ACE. \\n\\nDo NOT give your business to companies that are poorly run, unorganized, and consistently frustrates their customers. ACE is one of those companies.What a bunch of fucking idiots running this place. Tried to return keyboard that died & i had phoned into customer service..no problem, come on in. WRONG!!! Keyboard i had purchased does not match model # on receipt. Who\\'s fault is that. Stupid computer did not read SKU correctly. So guess who is stuck with a keyboard that does not work..ME.  Tried logic with these high school dropouts, that was way over their heads. Anyway, last time i go to this store . Best Buy is dying just for reasons like this. Stick with Amazon. Best Buy will be Good Bye soon.Beware of this business!  We had a Groupon for a haircut for my wife.  When we arrived in Las Vegas, we called and were told there were no appointments for four days.  Well, we were leaving in four days.  A visit to her shop proved fruitless.  She wasn\\'t there and when another hairdresser called her, she again said no appointments and refused to give the business to the other hairdresser.  Bad experience to say the least!I have had great service at the Main Street location but the AIRPORT LOCATION is less to be desired.  Also, I pre-paid my reservation and then there was a better deal a day later.  They would not let me change but the girl on the phone said that she would put it in my notes to have it switched to the upgraded car at the same price at the airport.  No dice!  The airport guy didn\\'t let me do that and he said there was no note.  I will NEVER pre-pay an offer with Advantage again.  There is no benefit to giving your money up front.  I could make a reservation and cancel it at the last moment and get something else from another company.  You would think that advantage would give the benefits to people who are willing to pay ahead.  Never again at Advantage Airport no matter what the price!!!  \\n\\nOh and I asked for a Corolla which they had available and he gave me a Jetta.  I didn\\'t care too much for the Jetta and would have liked the Corolla better.  Why couldn\\'t they switch it to what I requested?  There wasn\\'t anyone getting cars at advantage where Thrifty next to them had 7-9 people waiting.  Next time for the airport location I\\'d better go with another company. \\n\\nThat being said... The Main St. location is great!  I usually fly with Vacations Hawaii but this time we didn\\'t.  That was an unfortunate decision. If I used Vacations Hawaii, I would have had the opportunity to use the Main St. location and had better service and a better car.  If this was the Main St. location, I would have givien all \"9-10\\'s\".I\\'ve eaten enough frozen dinners to know that their alfredo dinner is just a frozen dinner meal reheated. Same noodles, sauce, and chicken. Same with their jalapeño poppers. Stick to the pizza here, it\\'s decent.The tables and floor were dirty. I was the only customer on a Saturday nite and  the person working the counter ignored me I had a corned beef sandwich. I took three bites  and threw it in the trash:(I originally placed a comment on yelp in regards to the lack of service from this agents office. The fact is this agent has a complete lack of understanding of listening and acknowledging issues that arise.\\nSuch as incorrect information, my policy information being sent to someone that I had requested not be sent certain information. as well as incorrect information stated and the lack of taking responsibility. \\nI recently received a call from the agent Mary advising me she had received my request to switch agents, which I sent much earlier on. The agent had taken a lengthy amount of time to transfer my policy, which I confirmed does not take much time to take place. Even after my policies where transferred to the new agent she or her office still failed to send everything over which caused a delay in obtaining a life insurance policy. Mary personally requested I remove my yelp page comment. I advised I would not. She explained that she feels its incorrect. I explained she can comment on my review as I have done for my own personal business. I advised her I felt it was very unethically for her to ask me to remove it. \\nAt that point the conversation came to end.\\nToday 10/13 I received an email from Yelp reference case 5065974 advising me they had removed my review of yelp because it had been brought to their attention by the yelp community that it fell outside of their content guidelines because it did not provide enough detail. It a little funny that someone had said that to yelp, after receiving a verbal request from Mary herself to remove it. I will pursue this unethical action further.I would give 0 stars if possible. This Tim Hortons is very slow, and every time i have been here there has been some problem. Their hash browns always taste bad and the employees are very rude. If you have a complaint about your order or they forget something they get angry with you, even though they are the ones that screwed up.   Everyone i know now avoids this tims because it is not worth the time or effort. Definitely avoid this timmies.I went into every other casino and they were all closing up shop. This was it. I had the turkey club. Really it was nothing I would ever order again. Not that I would come back here. When I went to pay the bill. Our waitress kept stretching her neck to see what kind of a tip I was leaving. When I handed the receipt to the cashier, this broad was bent over the counter. Are you kidding me. Oh! Get me odda this place.Food is too salty. Service was horrible. Only one member of our party of six received their food, while the rest of us waited more than an hour after they received their food. Was there for a birthday celebration. Brought our own cake. Waited forever for the waiter to bring the cake and then he brought out only one piece with the sparklers burnt half way down. The point was to bring out the WHOLE cake withe the sparklers still burning when they reach the table. The waiter was horrid as was the food. I will NEVER go back...despite the fact that many have told me it was an isolated incident...I think it would be too coincidental to have a terrible waiter and chef on the same night.Beware. My dog was on a medication that was critical to her health. I picked up my dog and she was having seizures, a trip to the doggie ER resulted in expensive tests that concluded that her medication was not administered. I phoned the kennel and said why wasn\\'t my dog given the meds, the answer was \"she wouldn\\'t take it\" seriously I brought pill pockets with explicit directions. If your a kennel specializing in doggie care you should know how to administer meds. The vet asked what kennel it was and said \"don\\'t worry vets talk\" he was furious, and said this was not acceptable for a kennel.The staff is rude. Katherine would not activate my guest pass that I filled out online & did not give me a valid reason. \\n\\nThis gym is very dirty and needs new equipment. Everything is always broken down & staff is always unavailable.I should have listened to the reviews on yelp! I hate ABSOLUTELY HATE this rooms to go. I am probably one of the nicest people in the world and I had to be so rude to the sales person here. Everything is ridiculous here. No organization what so ever. The sales people are liars and all over the place. They don\\'t honor sales or coupons. They also charge separate delivery fees for different sets.  This place needs to be shut all the way down! Spending 4K and not being told thank you or receiving any type of customer service is ridiculous!My fiancé and I were very displeased when it became clear that we had been the target of a bait and switch. We were extremely stressed when this became clear one week before our wedding. I would recommend steering clear of this company.\\n\\nWe completed a reservation form through Opex Limousine, fully disclosing at that time that we were using the services for a wedding. We received a quote back which reflected a service type as \"Wedding.\" We agreed to their three hour minimum at a rate of $110/hr and specified two trips only: hotel to church, church to reception, all within the downtown core. We specified there were to be no additional stops and no additional services were required. The final quoted rate was $330+tax and tip.\\n\\nWhen we were asked to sign the online documents to confirm the transportation, the price had ballooned to $1,200. \\n\\nUpon inquiry, we were told weddings required a six hour minimum, at a completely different hourly rate. When we asked what we would be getting in return, we were told it included unlimited stops, a \"just married\" sign and some other amenities we had no interest in. We reiterated that we required two stops only, and requested that they make no special arrangements whatsoever. When we asked again, \"what is the difference in service level when you have removed all of these undesired amenities?\" They admitted the only difference was that the driver would wear a suit. \\n\\nPerhaps he planned to use the additional $900 we would be paying him to take a Porter flight to Newark, where he would score an sweet deal on a Halston three-piece at Century 21.\\n\\nThe only compromise they would make was to allow us to book three hours, rather than six, however, with their new \"wedding rate\" the cost was still twice as much as our original estimate. We promptly cancelled the service completely, which is a shame, because we were planning to request additional services at the end of the evening for ourselves, and for some of our elderly guests.\\n\\nThis company needs to understand that the wedding industry is very small. Our day-of-coordinator, a senior Wedding and Special Events Coordinator at Oliver and Bonnacini (and the rest of her colleagues) were not impressed when we explained why we would be using über for transportation throughout our wedding day.Dated.  Greasy.  Poor/rude service.  Taco salad soaking in grease is not good, and when you say something the response shouldn\\'t be well you ordered it.  Too bad it has been a west valley staple but something bad has happen.Terrible knowledge at the store.  Nobody in the store had a clue about adobe Lightroom.  Didn\\'t know you could buy the program. When I told them it was online they found it in the store. Then I asked if the program could be downloaded via net versus disk. They said I\\'d have to buy a dvd ram for another $40 bucks.  Would never recommend going there. Clueless!  So, I bought the program through adobe online, which was a breeze.After reading all the raves about how good this place was I decided to try it. This place is the epitome of American style Thai food. Why ?\\nWell , for starters, the chicken satay is dark meat and fried. Need I say more ? In fact , I think it was twice fried because it was like eating leather.\\nI\\'ve had satay in about 20 different places....always grilled white meat. I could go on and rip this place to hell, but why bother ?\\nWith a name like Archi\\'s no doubt Jughead is running this place....There is a Terrible\\'s drive through car wash catty corner... but... it\\'s terrible. Not really a drive thru, more like a \"sit there and let the machine spray you type \"Products frequently precipitate, orders are never on time, customer service is terribleDon\\'t come to this location! Bad customer service I specifically asked for a hand wash then they ran it through the machine!Today was my 1st time here. I just moved here from so. cal so I am on the search for a new nail home. I must say that I will never return here. My nail tech was a man and he was horrible. I got a full set and they were way roo bulky. I told him about it and he didn\\'t think there was anything wrong. But he proceeded to tell me that it would be an extra charge because it would be considered shaping outside of the normal square tip shape. But all I wanted was square...he gave me triangles.\\n\\nAfter he \"fixed\" my acrylics, he painted my nails with a pink gel that I picked out. The paint job was beyond horrible. I ended up choosing another color (non gel). Even with him taking the gel off, he didn\\'t make sure it was completely off. Now, with the new color, u can see the punk around the edges of my nail and it is still a horrible paint job.\\n\\nOn my 1st trip here, I didn\\'t leave with a good impression. There may be other nail techs that are good but based off of this 1st visit, I don\\'t wanna risk wasting my money for another horrible job.\\n\\nWell Arizona...the search continues.This is going to be my first time to write a restaurant review. I had dinner there last night with my friends it was a birthday party. We made reservation at 7pm and we were sat around 7:30pm.I can say this is the most horrible experienced  dining I ever had. As soon as we sat down we order drinks it took forever to come out and some drinks our waitress forgot. We ordered the food one of my friend ordered the apetizer but it came out with her meal. We waited for so long for the food to come out we were really starving and honestly it\\'s not worth to wait for what you are paying. Service was horrible she have no idea what she was doing when the check came she charged us 4 sangria that we didn\\'t get!!! It honestly ruin our plan for that night because we had to spend literally 3 and half hours waiting for the service that it was awful slow. I WILL NEVER EVER COME BACK TO THIS PLACE AND I WILL TELL TO ALL THE PEOPLE THAT I KNOW TO BEWARE OF THIS RESTAURANT!!!!HORRIBLE SERVICE, FOOD WASN\\'T GOOD AT ALL I WISH I CAN GIVE ZERO STAR!I love the brasserie! Think it is a fantastic beautiful environment with class and a bit of pub flair. Totally happy with the style and just the place I want to bring my friends. I have introduced many people to this place and so happy to keep bringing more. \\n\\nFor this reason, It was foie gras night and I love this stuff! We bought multiples and multiples of these with salads and lots of bread, spent over $100 on a regular Tuesday night. The most impressive moment of the night was the CHEF! \\n\\nHe puts his heart and soul into his work and you can see it. We weren\\'t a big fan of the cold foie gras and asked to heat it up. Silly us, it would melt but instead he brought us some honey and gave us advice on a very beautiful way to eat it. Learned something new and so grateful that he took the time to really show us how food can truly be amazing. Our waitress was amazing, totally accommodating for my foie gras addition and super nice. I have waitressed for 13 years and know what is poor service and know what is excellent service. She was just amazing! On a previous occasion bringing another friend who was new our waitress was amazing. I have never had anything bad to say about the service. \\n\\nI decided to bring another friend their showing him how beautiful the food would be and eager to get the same great service that I had had in the past. But my experience was much different. \\n\\nWe sat in the booth section in the back seated by our server. He asked what would you like to drink. Usually I love wine and nice drafts but I was convinced to stay on my detox from alcohol that month. Liver needs a break sometimes. lol. I told him in a jokie manner I\\'m on a detox thinking nothing of it. We asked for water and then ordered cranberry juice. Took a look at the menu deciding on the amazing food we could eat and it was if our water had just decided to shun us. Literly lol. It was very strange. \\n\\n5 minutes had past and as he would walk by he would turn his head the other way and I thought nothing of it in the beginning. So we took our time deciding and waited, 5 more minutes had past. He had to walk past us every time to pick up an order but turn is head completely in the opposite direction. So I just put down our menus so he would know we were ready and 5 more minutes past. We are now 15 minutes in with 2 waters and juice. There were maybe 3 couples in the restaurant and I would try and get his attention each time he walked past us and his head was always 180 in the opposite direction. I asked my friend if I was crazy and we watched him walk 5 times by ignoring us almost purposely. I was in incredible disbelieve of 20 minutes and maybe 25 times walking by with 3 couples and no service. \\n\\nFinally after this time he came over and said what would you like. I said I\\'m sorry we have been really waiting a long time and I am unhappy with the service. He said, \" I am busy!\" I asked for the bill and paid and left no tip. \\n\\nI would not want to see him on a busy night. I don\\'t know if he was having a bad night or judged me on my detox or whatever this service was all about but all I know that we were ignored and were treated coldly. I hope this is not his service on a regular basis cause that is a true shame to other customers paying good money and hope if he was going through something that everything is ok. We all have bad days. \\n\\nThis left a very sour taste in my mouth. I am sorry to say I won\\'t be back because the Chef is truly a gift.Greeter at the door was rude and he have attitude problem. The waiter was not friendly and screwed our drinks too. Poor service and customer service. NEVER AGAIN will i come here with the same greeter.Food is great but they cancelled Taco Tuesday, ON TACO TUESDAY!!!!! What kind of a Mexican place is this?!?!?!  super bummed so we ended up coming to Urban Taco for $1.50 street tacos #tacotuesdayThey destroyed my cameras that were mounted to my roof. They worked on my house when I was out of town. I came back to all my cameras laying on the ground and the cables were all severed. I spoke with Gary many times but all he wanted to do is argue about it. This was a very bad experience!I had heard about this New York style bakery from several people in my community, and really looked forward to going.  My wife and I drove about 30 minutes to get there.  I will just focus on the quality of the bear claw and the pecan danish.  They were both heavy and lacking in full flavor and left a feeling of a coating in our mouths that we simultaneously noticed after the first bite.  \\nThe decorum was old and drab.  Service was OK, but not \"friendly\".  A customer there was uncomfortably loud and rude to a sweet looking elderly lady that he thought was butting in front of him for service.  \\nIn summary I won\\'t go back there to try anything else, I will stick to our local bakery, Sugar and Spice, whose bear claws are a 10 out of 10.It\\'s was a great place previously but now down to earth. From menu delete best lots, and today I\\'m coming before close 40 minuts. I\\'m driven 20 min, because yelp show this place close at 11 pm. Finally shef say me - not today and go out, don\\'t ask maybe I\\'m wanna stay in bar and drink. Doesn\\'t have time to another restaurant, because loose time for him. Bad serviceDr. Montana is a misogynist. He tried to make me feel stupid because I brought my dog in to have her teeth looked at because I thought it looked like she had cavities or gum disease. He laughed at me & told me \"dogs don\\'t get cavities\". (Not true). He then laughed at me and repeated to me several times that \"yeah, (chuckle chuckle) I\\'m sure she has cavities on both sides of her mouth at the same time, unilaterally\". I don\\'t know how he found this funny? I also asked him to look at growth on her face. Which again he tried to condescend & berate me.  Not a nice man!\\n\\nUpon arriving at home I looked up dental cavities in dogs because I still felt my dog has some kind of dental disease. I found an article on Dental Caries in Dogs....\\n\"Dental caries is a condition in which the dental hard tissues decay as the result of oral bacteria on the tooth surface. While dental caries is not common in the domestic pet, it does occur and should be watched for. A 1988 study, reported in the Journal of Veterinary Dentistry, found that 5.3 percent of dogs one year of age or older had one or more caries lesions, with 52 percent of that group having BILATERALLY SYMMETRICAL lesions. Caries can affect the crown or the roots of the teeth, and is classified as pit-and-fissure caries, smooth-surface caries, or root caries. There is no known breed, age, or gender risk.\"\\n\\nDr. Montana here\\'s what I have to say to you, \"we WON\\'T be coming back!\"Because of my experience at this store, I will never shop at a Party City again!  We asked an associate named Janet to assist with balloons, specifically, where the \"congratulations\" balloons were and she rudely replied with a chuckle, \"I don\\'t carry those\".  Um hello, first of all, I didn\\'t realize she owned the Party City store and second, why was it funny?  Isn\\'t Party City a store for all occasions?!  Don\\'t they consider themselves a \"city\" since it\\'s in their name....wouldn\\'t that imply they cover all occasions?!  Janet had an attitude from the minute we walked in.  She was rude, condescending and sarcastic for no reason.  She also made various rude comments to my friend who had questions.  Upon checking out, she never once smiled or said thank you.  To make matters worse, we bought 26 balloons and 4 popped before we made it to our destination 3 miles away.  Looking at the balloons once we took them out of the bags, they were inconsistent in size...many over inflated which I\\'m sure is why they popped on our way.  I decided to repurchase my other items online and am returning the Party City purchase.  Service like this does not deserve patronage.The customer service at this bakery is horrendous. I ordered a plain white cake for a party noting when I ordered it that I would be storing it over night and serving it the next day. When I went to pick up my cake, it was not plain white as requested but instead covered in chocolate drizzle and lumps. I was told by the ladies working that I could \"just scrape it off with a knife.\" They didn\\'t even offer to help fix it. The box they wanted me to take the cake home in also didn\\'t fit the size of cake I ordered, and wouldn\\'t come close to closing shut. I was told it costs extra for a box that will actually close... What?!?!? Buyer beware.Got sucked in by a booth on the strip, claiming they could give me tickets to a show for cheaper if I sat through a timeshare meeting. I was just trying to give my beautiful wife the time of her life for her birthday and was instead stuck in a 4 hour \"meeting\", if I could even call it that. It was full of hassling and berating, definitely not a friendly environment. They tried scamming me into a timeshare for an interest rate of 17.8%!! After sitting there for over 3 hours, they would not take no for an answer for place that was not worth it. At one point Mr.Spitter yanked a wad of cash out of his pocket and counted it in front of me, claiming I was  cheap for not wanting his disgusting timeshare.\\nWhat kind of company is this? Definitely the worst time I\\'ve ever spent in my life and dampered my whole experience. ONE LIE AFTER THE OTHER, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH TAKE A BREAK TRAVEL!! 4 HOURS AND $76 DOLLARS LOST ON THIS STUPID TIMESHARE DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!After reading reviews, we decided to finally try Avenue B as it had been on our list for quite some time. I have to say, I found everything about this place to be lackluster. We had The Raw Deal appetizer, and I can\\'t think of a more apt name for a $16 plate of mushy fish that had gone one too many pulses through the food processor. It was almost inedible. After that, we had the duck and meat loaf entrees, which were not terrible in flavor, but were both prepared poorly. The temperatures were off (warm potatoes, hot onion rings, room temperature meatloaf), the duck was medium well (despite ordering mid-rare), and the sides were just off, for lack of a better word. It\\'s possible we caught the kitchen on a bad night, but this was entirely overpriced even if it had been good. We spent nearly $100 for an awful appetizer and two entrees that we barely ate half of, and I\\'m already regretting the fact that I have leftovers in the fridge. There are much better options in the city, both cheaper and better, and I will not be returning to Avenue B.The worst experience in vegas. We had time share credit to use and this place sucked. Not only we will never go back here, we wont even recommend it to anyone. Worst customer service and bunch of scammers. Do not sign up with their complimentary breakfast because a sale persons will be sitting with you the whole time and eating with you and trying to sell you time share which is so over priced and useless. Please stay away from these scammersThis may be the worst take out I\\'ve had in Charlotte. Got a chicken ribs combo. The chicken was ok, just absolutely bland and devoid of flavor. The ribs on the other hand are the poorest excuse for pork I\\'ve EVER HAD! Though they are virtually devoid of meat, there\\'s plenty of fat and grizzley to make up for it. So greasy, so so greasy. The plantains were dry and textural unappealing. The fries were still raw. I don\\'t mean cold, I mean undercooked. Not sure what kind of cooks they have bit they failed French Fry 101. Overall the best and only good part of the meal was the sauce. So just skip the EXTREMELY subpar food and just get a bowl of sauce. Whoever represents this \"restaurant\" should be ashamed.Capital One is the absolute worst bank in the country. I called hundreds of times trying to get help with a dispute. Agents don\\'t answer calls or ever return voicemail messages. They will transfer you all over the world. Unbelievably they say they are mailing info-then faxing NOTHING! Stay away from this horrible company! It\\'s impossible to get help and they NEVER call when they say they will. It\\'s sickening. AVOID this company!Incredibly slow and rude! About a month ago I went to Ling & Louie\\'s for take out. The order was more than 25 minutes overdue, and when I simply asked how much longer it would be, the bartender said very rudely that it\\'s not her problem.  She never did check on the order, and I got the idea I was being ignored, so after another 25 minutes I simply left. I decided I would give them another chance tonight, so I went in for my pick up order at the time it was supposed to be ready, and it wasn\\'t ready, and I waited another 25 minutes. I asked the bartender how much longer it would be, and she just said I don\\'t know, with no indication she was going to find out. I asked again a few minutes later how much longer it would be, and pointed out I\\'ve been waiting for a long time. She said I could talk to the manager if I wanted, with no other solution offered, so I said yes then I\\'d like to talk to her manager very much. At that point she spent the next 10 minutes waiting on customers and doing one task after another with out informing her manager that I was waiting to speak with him. Unbelievable!!! I finally just walked out again. That\\'s the last time I will walk him to his ridiculously rude restaurant.Undoubtedly the rudest management in the City of Charlotte I wouldn\\'t go there if was the only restaurant in Charlotte!!!!  I had a voucher from Liviing Social which was to expire in September 25th which I was going to use on the day but an emergency came up and I could not use it.  I called Living Social and asked what could be done they advised me to call the restaurant and ask for an extension to the following weekend which I did.  I asked for a manager and told him of my problem the answer was YOU HAVE HAD ENOUGH TIME TO USE YOUR VOUCHER GOODBYE!!!!!  There are so many fine steak houses in Charlotte that want to accommodate customers then why go to one like this.  After reading the other reviews on Living Social about the rudeness of the staff and their service much less there food I tore up the voucher why waste any more money on a 3rd class restaurant~~Horrible costumer service and nail work.  The owner or what ever he is, is a total jerk and is very rude.Customer service is a joke! I\\'ve been trying to reschedule an open blanket for a deferent date, but they keep transferring my call to some spa. Not only that but when they pick up the phone I can here them giggling and talking amongst themselves and are clearly not paying attention to what I am trying explain... disgusting to say the least.Umm straight out they are a huge scam. Every time I would bring by vehicle in for a simple tire rotation, they would seem to always find an issue with my car. Ever since I stopped going to them, haven\\'t had a problem since.TI  offers two for one special with limited food to eat and bad service a very disappointment buffet not worth the money.After eating at Mad Dogs, my only comment is: \\n\\nUgh, Chicago-style hotdogs, or Madison-style shitdogs?So this is more of a public service-type announcement. \\nI just want to make sure everyone is aware of the situation that happened a few weeks ago at this Petsmart location....\\nA newfoundland was brought in for grooming, in good health...and when the owner returned to pick her up she was incoherent and her temperature was 109 degrees. The dog did not make it, her organs were fried. It\\'s clear the dog was kept in a very hot facility for too long. There is no other way a dog\\'s temp can get this high. Please look up this story before you consider bringing your dog here for grooming!Went down to Wet Willies on Saturday night, valet parked our car, when we got home we realized that a couple things had been stolen out of our glovebox, as well as there was a HUGE scratch down the side of the truck. If you value your possessions / cars, DO NOT USE THE AMERIPARK VALET!! We called Wet Willies, they were very helpful by hooking us up with the people we needed to talk to, when we spoke to the valet service they basically told us \"your loss\" and \"you should have checked your car before you left\". I mean REALLY!??? Is this what we have to worry about when paying for a service? That our stuff will be stolen and we are SOL if we don\\'t search our cars before we leave to make sure everything is still there??? Wonderful people you hire there.Rude ass service staring from the main woman servicing. Tried to push us to sit outside in hot ass weather. Then when we got a table I knew why. Cause we had a big group of 9 with 6 kids. And pretty loud in there and the old lady had the nerve to tell my son speak with your inside voice twice while touching his shoulder. Horrible don\\'t ever go here unless you want to whisper.i made the mistake of ordering takeout from here. this place is incredibly overhyped by people who obviously have no idea of what flavor is. I got the duck bowl and the duck was dry and a leather boot and drowned in soy sauce. my friend got the tofu appetizer and the tofu tasted like it got forgotten in the freezer. I got the Shizu ramen and it was truly appalling and I didn\\'t even finish it the broth tasted like it came from a maruchan pack. this food was not worth the 45$I booked a day trip for two on Groupon for the Grand Canyon South Rim tour. This is the worst organized tour company I have ever seen.  I made reservations one week in advance - 24 hour advance reservation was required. I was told to be outside my hotel at 6:15am on the morning of our tour. We were there a 6:05am. I called at 6:26am, and was told the driver was about 10 minutes away. Called back a second time at 6:45am and was told by Rosie that the driver was on his way back from dropping off other customers, but would pick us up and that our tour bus would not leave the station, which was scheduled to leave at 7:30am, without us. You guessed it, by 7:15am, still no driver. I call a third time and was told by a woman named Lee to just take a cab to their bus terminal located at 795 E. Tropicana and I\\'d be reimbursed. We take a cab which with fare and tip was $11. Pete, the person in charge, would only pay me $10, as they wouldn\\'t pay the can driver $1 tip. .... Nothing was offered for the inconvenience and our wait. It gets better, we are placed on a 40 passenger bus with no working toilet with about 10 passengers. This meant we had to make extra stops for an already long trip. To top things off, the driver, Barry, kept taking his hands off the wheel particularly while we were on the winding roads near Hoover Dam. Not the company to use to see one of the wonders of the world.We were here around 12:00 pm and waiting for about 1 hr in line to get the pager. We got the number 27 and the server told us it takes about 60 mins to get the seat. \\n  HOWEVER, the pager DO NOT have any response after almost 3 hrs. Therefore we decided go back to the reception to find the reason. \\n  The receptionist extremely UNPROFESSIONAL and NO ANY APOLOGIES, even the guests before us already finished meal but definitely there is something wrong with the pager! \\n  Even like this, they didn\\'t give us any solutions and response, No apology and with cold face. We have to stand there about another 20 mins to get the seat!!!!\\n\\nWill NEVER EVER come back and do not want to pay the tips!I should give 0 star to this location!!! Kidding me? Calling for half an hour while driving around, and then being told to park my car first, and walk in to rent the car?!  On the phone with a guy all the way looking for a tiny little cardboard written the name in the end.. What the hell!!! No sign outside, no instructions, WTF!!\\n\\nStay away from this, if you don\\'t want to waste your time, and ruin your vacation!!Do not stay at this Holiday Inn if you need to connect to their WiFi to get work done!  You cannot stay connected in your room.  If you want to work you will need to go to their Lobby to get and stay connected.  I am Diamond member with another chain, that had no availability this night, so I chose this IHG property, which I normally have a positive experience at.  I spent an hour in my room, rebooting my computer (I work for a computer company so this is 101 stuff for me) and getting connected for a few brief moments, just to get disconnected, after talking 3 times to the front desk (who was by the way very helpful and very understanding, so 5 stars for her).  Finally went to the front desk, where magically my computer connected, stayed connected to the internet and my company VPN.  But when I returned to my room, same thing, disconnected, could not connect.  Finally had to use my phone in my hotel room as a hot spot and hope I do not have to download any files tonite!  Never staying here again!I have to say this car wash has been the worst, every tine we go something is missed. We\\'ve tried this place 3 times thinking maybe it will get better but it never has. Car is not cleaned properly windows with spots and we had them vacuum our car again. You\\'re not suppose to baby sit people who should be doing their job.Typical 1 hour wait for a car.  Prepaid and still a crazy wait. Been here several times and this seems to be the standard.  Maybe fix the issue Budget?!Dumbest place ever! Tried to order sweet and sour chicken with shrimp fried rice. I was told i couldn\\'t replace the flavorless steamed rice for shrimp fried rice I\\'d have to order a separate 6 dollar order of fried rice. You\\'ve got to be joking. No way in hell. And then when i said well screw the meal give me an order of shrimp fried rice and a side of sweet and sour chicken she cant speak English so well...after trying to order for 15 mins ..needless to say i will not be going back....NFL football on and I\\'m listening to Casey Kasum tip hits from 1978. What is the target demographic? This isn\\'t the only time I left due to terrible ambiance. I\\'ll keep  giving this place a chance because of the happy hour pizza and wings. I hope they will find an identity.If you like overpriced food then this is your place!!!  And don\\'t expect a breakfast burrito at breakfast time because I have been by twice at 8:30am and even though the door says they open at 8, its not true.  The 3rd time I came was the last time for me.  $6 and change for a bean and egg burrito is absurd.the manager of megatunes breathes down my neck every tme i go in. i\\'m not sure whether he thinks i\\'m a shoplifter or what, but it\\'s irritating.\\n\\nthis store does have more good music than most else in calgary, but frankly i\\'ve been feeling a little cheated since i saw the edmonton megatunes! way nicer. no fair! \\n\\nregardless, i check sloth first and buy cds there when i can.Very rude staff. Horrible service. The restaurant is empty and we\\'re told we have to wait 15 minutes to be seated.  We decide to order to go. We ask if we can get our food as it\\'s coming out to feed the kids as quickly as possible, and the cashier says, \"If you eat here, don\\'t make a lot of noise because we have to take care of our normal customers.\" I remind the cashier that the restaurant is EMPTY. At the end of our meal we ask if we can give them the trash that we packed back up neatly and the cashier says, \"The trash box is outside\" and points me to the dumpster. The ridiculousness of the whole situation earned their one star rating!I am writing this based on my opinion before the illness outbreak at this location. I ate there once awhile back and liked the food. Line was ridiculously long, staff not all that friendly, but food was good. Thus I wanted to return. I brought my husband there about a month ago and it was gross. We got beef items and every bite had gristle and fat. I was so grossed out. On top of that line was still slow and staff was very unfriendly. It\\'s like they were just part of a machine and not responding to you like people. They weren\\'t really listening either. It was strange. Place was pretty messy too. I will not go back, especially not to this location, especially now. I still can imagine the feeling of that fatty meat. Ew!$$$$$$ for Boho? No thanks! \\n\\nI\\'ve been shopping at Anthropologie in Beverly Hills and NYC since my teens. While it was always a little pricier than I would have preferred, I splurged for pretty, unique and well made garments. \\n\\nSince bringing the chain to Canada, the prices are DOUBLE that of American stores. Not to mention that the American stores have better and more frequent sales. After browsing a few times, I refuse to shop there in Toronto. \\n\\nThe store itself is cleverly set up like a nice thrift shop, but the prices are astronomical for ho-hum things made in China. \\n\\nI have honestly found more beautiful and better crafted Bohemian clothes in the finer thrift shops downtown. That is the style Anthropologie is venturing after; a vintage Boho look. \\n\\nAt that price, I\\'d rather look cookie-cutter.Bottom line: Any other rental car company at sky harbor is a better choice than Budget. Unless you are a masochist, probably a good idea to stay away from Budget rental car in general.\\n\\nReview: Budget rental car is actually the tenth circle of Hell that Dante didn\\'t yet know about. An almost two hour wait to get a car. Three incompetent employees working the counter. It\\'s the last place very bad people go after they\\'ve been through all nine circles. The experience of being a budget rental car customer is like paying to be tortured. The collected mass of disgruntled customers sharing the experience with me applauded in unison when two additional employees emerged from the back room, bringing the total customer service representatives to five. That genius staffing decision took 90 minutes to accomplish, yet somehow the line continued to move at a pace DMV customers would smile gleefully and laugh at. I will never rent from budget rental car again.Made a 9:30 appnt , it was confirmed, show up on time at 9:30 doors are locked , call them up and he ( Sam) says he will be there at 10. !!! WOW WHAT A CRAZY FIRST IMPRESSION!!! completely disrespectful of people\\'s time !!!Do not expect any hospitality from Jim Alexander if you are booking a private party here.  I booked the Serengeti room a little over a month in advance and was told by Jim himself that I would have great service and the best food.  It is important to me when I am booking a private party that I have a completely enclosed space so people can hear the speaker and see the presentation.  I paid my $150 deposit, worked out the menu and was ready for my evening.  The day of the event I stopped by the restaurant early to set up the projector and was told I had been moved into a different room that was not enclosed.  I wanted to know why I hadn\\'t been contacted in advance and what had happened since that was not what I agreed to.  The manager, Michael Stauss wasn\\'t sure what happened and went to get the owner, Jim.  Jim finally came out and said I was now in this room and that they would do what they could to make it right for me.  When I told him I still wanted the room I had booked, he stated with anger that I was NOT getting that room.  No explanation.  I told him I was confused on why nobody had contacted and wanted to know what the reason was for getting moved.   He then threw up his hands, said he couldn\\'t deal with me and stormed from the room.  Since my guests were due to arrive in just a few hours, I had no choice but to deal with the current situation although he had completely rattled my nerves and upset me.  I was not pleased by the room situation during the event, it was still loud from the people singing happy birthday in the other room and although I was told people would be routed through the kitchen to get to the the main dining hall, they came through our room instead.  One man walked all the way through the room confused on where to go.  Other than the room situation, Michael did everything he could to make the situation better including sending me home with a bottle of wine and taking some of the extra fees off of my bill.  The staff was nice and professional and the food was very good.  One of my guests said it was the best salmon he ever had.  Still, after the event, I was emotionally drained that I had been treated so rudely by Jim.  Although the food was great, because of my experience with Jim, I would never have another event here.  At the very least, it is the responsibility of the restaurant to uphold their agreement with you.We had tickets to go see Penn & Teller at the Rio. Since the Rio is slightly off the strip, we decided to head over there, grab a bite to eat, and then go see the show. \\n\\nWe looked at the lounge menu and saw burgers/sandwiches in the $10-12 range and decided to go for it. Maybe a tad over the odds pricewise, but a downright steal by Vegas standards. \\n\\nThere were beers listed on the menu, but no wines. I asked the waiter for a wine list. He told me could tell me the wines available by the glass. He rattled off five choices, including two Cabernets. I was not familiar with either of them, but he told me they were \"both from California.\" (I head him telling another customer that about her Chardonnay and have no idea why that was supposed to matter. But, I digress...). I picked one of the Cabernets at random. The waiter told me it was the \"better\" of the two. I had no idea what the price was going be, but figured it was probably, at worst, going to be somewhere in the $9 range. (The beers on the menu were slightly above the odds costwise, but not outrageous.) \\n\\nImagine my shock when our bill came and I saw we had been charged $16 for a glass of wine!!!  It was a nice enough pour, but I never would have ordered it had I known it was that expensive. Ok, my mistake for not asking. But, really, that had to have been significantly more expensive than the other wines on the menu and the waiter really should have warned us. \\n\\nYes, our tab ended up being higher than expected, but that does not mean we left a better tip.  We left feeling ripped off and the whole thing put a damper on our evening.  So, what did anybody gain?I decided to try Marvellous Edibles because of the rave review the first reviewer gave it, and because it is in my neighborhood of Leaside. I\\'ve always driven past it and wondered what it was like, but since she gave it such a great review, I thought I\\'d give it a go. \\n\\nThe restaurant has a sort of Parisian cafe feel to it, with mismatched chairs and some booths and tables, and a mural on the wall. Upon arrival mid-Saturday afternoon, we were also presented with 3 menus, breakfast (which was ending shortly), sandwiches and another menu which appeared to be dinner options, priced $16 - $24 range. My friend and I both selected from the sandwich menu. \\n\\nI ordered the BLT, but having noticed that they served peameal bacon for breakfast, asked if I could have peameal on my BLT, they obliged, no problem. My friend ordered the meat loaf sandwich and we both ordered the sweet potato fries. \\n\\nService was fast, there were only 2 other occupied tables in the restaurant. I was expecting an average sandwich, didn\\'t really figure you can screw up a BLT, er...thought wrong. The peameal was overcooked, and very dry, and it was served on \\'white\\' bread, no egg or challah bread to be found here!! I was disappointed. The whole sandwich was dry, I asked for mayo, and the waiter said there was already mayo on it, I opened it up and the thing was bare. I showed him, and said, \"Umm, actually there\\'s not...\" (awkward...) \\n\\nMy friend\\'s meatloaf sandwich was a mess!! First she had asked for no onions, was allergic to them, and upon receiving the sandwich, had to proceed to pick off somewhere in the range of 7-8 pieces of red onion off of her sandwich!! The problem with the sandwich was just that it was a complete mess. It was on a regular bun, and gravy was poured over the meatloaf and the other half of the bun was placed on top. On service, the bottom part of the bun, is soaked, drenched in gravy, making it impossible to pick up! It was just a mess, I think it would be a much more successful item choice if perhaps it was served as an open faced meat loaf sandwich, with the gravy in a boat on the side that you pour on yourself at the time you are going to eat it, so that the bottom bun doesn\\'t disintegrate. \\n\\nAs if our food quality wasn\\'t bad enough while we were attempting to salvage a meal out of it, our entertainment was listening to our waiter bicker with the other waitress about table assignment and allocation of tips and how unfair she had been. The disagreement got quite heated and their voices were raised, creating quite a bit of tension in the restaurant amongst the customers, or at least, that was my perception. \\n\\nOverall, I was not impressed with the food or the service of this restaurant. I would not recommend it. I will not be returning to try their breakfast or brunch, or even to give it a second chance. Unfortunately, that was my very first and last visit. You know what they say, you never get a second chance to make a first impression.Do yourself a favor and rent from a reputable car rental company. They mislead you on the pricing you get when you make an online reservation. They breakout the price differently on the estimated cost when you take delivery by adding an upgrade fee which they cross out and tell you not to worry about. Meanwhile, that is the price you are agreeing to pay because that is your contract. Don\\'t be fooled by the friendly staff. They work hard to hide the game they are playing. \\nOn top of that, they charge administrative fee per day for using the toll payment device ($5/day) for making one toll bridge pass.  When I inquired about their system prior to using the bridge, they told me not to worry, my card would be charged for the toll, they would not mention anything about the administrative fee. \\n\\nReally, when you think you are getting a good deal by choosing a cheap option, watch for every detail on the contract and make sure that\\'s the deal you want.Came here with some friends and the experience was pretty awful.  The food was mediocre and the service was horrible.  Do not waste your time or money here as it really isn\\'t worth it.  \\n\\nSo we had a few things since we had s group of 4.  Started off with the Deviled Eggs which I think were the best thing that we had.   The girls had the salads (Brussel Arugula Salad with shrimp and Brussel Arugula Salad with Salmon) and really enjoyed them. My buddy had the BBQ Platter which was a special for the evening.  He was pretty disappointed as there was no flavor in the brisket.  I had the Seared Tuna and again was lacking flavor.   \\n\\nSo many of you would say, hey send it back or tell the server.  Which brings me to my next issue.  Our server was nonexistent.   Didn\\'t check on us at all and saw her glance over and walk away multiple times.  We had to flag other wait staff to get additional drinks and service.  Not sure what the issue was.  We did manage to grab the manager and she was very apologetic and comped our appetizers and drinks.  Needless to say the server should choose another profession.   \\n\\nOne last thing that struck us as interesting is that this was an offshoot of Altons  Kitchen.   Honestly if I didn\\'t know better, I would have thought it was affiliated with 131 Main.   From the way the wait staff was dressed to the menu layout, it was pretty much identical.  The only thing that didn\\'t compare was the service.  Save your self the time and money skip this place.Jesus once said: :Hypocrite! First get rid of the log in your own eye; then you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend\\'s eye.\" Maybe Cox must apply this principle to their own poor service before running down other companies in their adverts!\\n\\nI scheduled an online appointment for the installation of a Contour DVR. The confirmation email was received, but the appointment never honored. No calls or email to apologize for not showing up.\\n\\nOn calling their help-desk and giving them the order reference #, they just said they cannot see such an order, pulled up their shoulders with a \"sorry,\" - and that\\'s that.\\n\\nReading all the reviews on this page, one just realizes that Cox does not care a damn about customer service. Bad, bad, bad!!!!I usually like BWW but this place was bad. Pretty empty when we got there at 8pm, a couple of 8-10 people groups came in and there was still plenty of room. First sign of trouble, \"I\\'ll have a ... IPA, draft\", comes back in a bit \"we are out of that\", \"I\\'ll have the Dogfish 60 IPA\" (a pretty standard IPA), comes back in a bit \"we are out of that, how about a Stone IPA\", \"Sure\" I say, comes back in a bit \"we are out of that\", WTF? My wife orders coffee, \"we are out of creamer, we do have milk\", OK, whatever. Put in a order for wings, pretty simple, it\\'s in their name, it took 1/2 an hour for them to show up. They would stop by every 5-10 minutes to see if we wanted a beer refill, no thanks, I\\'ll finish my food and get out of here.If it was possible to give this place a half of a star, I would. Tacky, unattractive waitresses. Poor concept. And the fact they are actually promoting poor health is extremely sad.  But then a again the owner is short and bald which explains everything. You have to try to get attention somewhere. It is no wonder some of the other branches are closing their doors.Food lacks flavor. Service is slow. A bit overpriced.I had a 10PM reservation after a show (At Caesars). The restaurant called me at noon to confirm. I told them I was coming right after the show. The person said that they would note that on my reservation. We walked in at 10:15 only to be told that the last reservation is at 10. We were turned away at our 30th wedding anniversary! This restaurant should honor a reservation after a show, especially a show at Caesars! Never again!!HORRIBLE service!  I understand if a business is busy, but you still try to offer some type of customer service.  \\nWe walk in and one associate yells out \"we\\'ll be with you in a minute\". After waiting 15 minutes...killing time looking at phones and for someone to ask us again if we needed assistance still NOTHING!  Two other customers walked in after us and no one bothered to yell out to them or even walk by. \\nYes, most of them were helping customers.  Some even doubled up having two associates helping customers.  I just feel it\\'s poor service if no one can even take 30 seconds to ask the reason you came in.  \\nThis was the second time at this location and I will NEVER go back to this location again.The chips and salsa were underwhelming. Chips - not made in house - were cold and flavorless. The salsa was ok but also lacked flavor and and was too small a portion. \\n\\nWe ordered green burritos enchilada style. The tortillas were thick and tasteless  and the filling was lukewarm and also lacking. The plate was hot se we suspect they simply stuck it in the microwave.\\n\\nThe only positives of our meal were the red enchilada sauce was tasty as was the margarita.This was a first for me.   Only two people at the bar but we couldn\\'t sit there because there was still plates and glasses from previous customers lined throughout the almost empty bar.   It was a disorganized mess.   Ordered an appetizer and left.  Another customer came and sat at a high top and left shortly after for lack of service.   It felt like no one was managing and nobody cared. Can\\'t comment on food because we never ordered due to the lack of service.The service sucked,,, if you want extraa chips u have to pay for evry bowl and cup of salsa,,, the tacos and tostadas were generic... shells tasted store bought and not the good ones either.. So for 2 people to eat, one combination dinner, 1 cheese crisp and 8 beers the bill came out to $65.oo WTH...... willnever go there again,,, not if its the last place on earth....\\nThumbs down all the wayDinner on a Wednesday night. We ordered 3 burgers and a kids grilled cheese. I had asked for a side salad with my burger. It was the best white vinaigrette salad dressing. That was the only good part of our meal. The salad was a plate of lettuce. No tomato, cucumber, not even a crouton to be found. Burgers arrived almost an HOUR later. They were dried out, and the buns were crappy and soggy from the meat siting there under the heat lamps for God knows how long (because the plates were hot... Meals weren\\'t!). My husband ordered fries - waitress said there would be an up charge - got the bill - $6! For fries... That were super soggy and oily. Long of the short: cool, old decor. That\\'s about it. Burgers were 12-15$ and way overpriced for the quality.This location provides horrible service! I waited in the drive through for over six-seven minutes even though there was only one other car ahead of me. My food was cold (especially the curly fries) leading me to believe that they had prepared my food and then left it sitting while they prepared the order for the car ahead of me. No thanks!Very Overrated on food and on service. Waitress was more concerned with a big tip then providing proper recommendations and providing service.We showed up after calling 30 minutes before and we were told 30 -45 minute wait and when we got here they told us there was a 2 hour wait . Horrible customer service , no apologies from rude girl at the deskI wish I read the reviews on this place earlier, because most of the reviews are about poor customer service and it\\'s true. I was here earlier looking at civics (CPO/new) for about 19k out the door. At first the salesman greeted us and helped us, but told us that our budget was too low. That\\'s all fine and dandy, we left, only to be stopped by the manager (Tony) who tried to work with us. We went inside again to see what he can do for us since he\\'s the manger. He listed several options for us, but we already knew what we wanted and none of the options he gave us were up to our standards. Once we stated our disinterest in the options, he was very rude about it. Saying \"Whatever\" to what we wanted in a civic. At that point I wanted to leave, I have a lot of patience and tolerance with people since I work in customer service for over 10 years. I stayed and gave him another chance because he could have more options for us. We checked KBB to see what\\'s a fair price for a used Honda Civic and we didn\\'t like what he was offering to us. Which is fine, we could\\'ve looked somewhere else. But once we mentioned that we would look somewhere else, he belittled us about using KBB. I am baffled at how this guy is in sales/customer service and who is the manager. They really don\\'t care about you or your business. Please Honda, get a new manager instead of Tony. Your dealership deserves better, and it can all happen with better customer service and without Tony.TERRIBLE HOTEL! My best friend had her wedding reception here so we traveled from MI to PA for two nights. Every time I called the hotel with questions IE \"is there a refrigerator in the room?\" Or \"is there a deposit for using a debit card at check in?\" Finally to \"how many pillows do you put on a king size bed?\" I got nothing but the runaround, either \"I have no idea\" to \"no\" or \"yes\" different answers every time. Their staff is terribly incompetent. \\n\\nDuring check in we were notified that not only do they charge the entire room rate for both nights on your debit card upon check in they also charge $40 a night for a deposit. Then they had the audacity to make us sign a paper saying the notified us. UGHHH how ridiculous. First set of keys they gave us didn\\'t open the room. Spent 10 minutes getting a new key that worked.\\n\\nThe next morning at 10am a staff member called my hotel room and told me I immediately needed to go to the front desk with a new credit card because mine was declined \"today\" and this needed to be sorted out immediately. I told her I would check my bank account and I would call her right back. I was pretty irritated that she called me that early and as she knew all the bridesmaids were getting their hair done in my room. Very unprofessional. I checked my bank account and they took out both despots and the normal room rate plus taxes both nights. I called this lady back and told her she\\'s mistaken and she told me I need to straighten this out because I couldn\\'t stay without paying! How dare her?! UGHHH then a moment later she says oh I\\'m sorry I ran it again just now and it looks like everything is fine sorry to bother you. I told her no I want to speak to your manager immediately. I spoke with Gary. Gary didn\\'t seem to understand my frustration until I told him his entire staff is incompetent. He apologized and offered to bring us free mimosas for our problems. I thought everything had been solved until I checked my bank account Sunday upon leaving and that idiot staff member ran my debit card AGAIN! I was out over $300 for 3 days while the incompetent staff tried to reverse the transaction. \\n\\nOn the looks of the hotel well nothing special honestly. I\\'ve stayed at better Days Inn and Comfort Inns. I would think with Hilton backing that hotel it would look cleaner but it honestly doesn\\'t. Bathroom amenities and the TVs were nice but that\\'s about all. Our door didn\\'t properly shut had to slam it to get it to shut. \\n\\nFor the wedding reception I was impressed by the lights which I learned after were never included in the wedding packed but were offered to the bride and groom since the hotel was under renovations. \\n\\nOh and the hotel does have refrigerators in ever room which apparently no staff remember knows except the manager! \\n\\nI\\'ve never been to a hotel that hired such incompetent staff members. When I come to visit my best friend and her husband in Pittsburgh I will NOT be staying here!Caveat Emptor! Took my car here because the tire place wanted me to have my car looked at by a mechanic after thinking my new tires were bad. I was told it was my differential & would cost $2200 to repair. Priced the repair through the dealer who quoted me $1600. Ended up taking it to the dealer & after further inspection found that it wasn\\'t even my differential, it was a wheel bearing that I was able to repair for $300!! Always get a second, even 3rd opinion & better yet take your car to the dealer and save yourself the money & grief!! Glad i didn\\'t get hosed for a very expensive repair that didn\\'t even need done.CAFE BRICCO is costing the Doubletree return business.  The Manager was unbelievably rude to us.  We\\'ve visited the Doubletree the last 4 years for our anniversary, this will be the last time.  After being locked on the patio the very rude manager of Bricco came to the door (I thought to let us in) and told us to jump the fence and go around to get back in.  I\\'ve just spent over $200 between our room and service in Bricco and I\\'m being told to jump a fence?!?  I don\\'t know who pissed in his Cheerio\\'s but it has cost the hotel my business.  Customer service at its worst.I went into this salon at 530 on a Wednesday evening there were only two other customers in the bldg.   I normally have the same girl do my nails, but she was doing another ladies nails so they gave me to another lady as I was explaining what I wanted done she had a hard time understanding I tried my best to explain,it was pretty simple ,she rolls her eyes at me and begins to get rude.  I am not gonna let her roll her eyes at me when I tip these girls 20 per visit.  There are 10 or more nail salons in this fiver mile radius. I won\\'t ever walk in there again they only do an ok job anywayFood is good, but I am giving a one star review for the hostess on duty on 7/3/2015 at ~11:40 am. We have 3 adults, 3 kids between 7-10, and one 2 yrs old baby in stroller arriving the entrance, the restaurant was about 1/5 packed, I asked \"do you have seat for 7 ?\", she answered me right away: \"No, we don\\'t\" even without turning her head over to take a look at the seating area.  I was surprised and shocked at that time, because it was obvious that there were plenty of seatings available.   I stood there until a waiter came to me and greeted us to the seats.  Well, we enjoyed the food here, yet do not appreciate the attitude of the hostess, when we walked out she didn\\'t even look at us, let alone giving us the \"thank you, good bye\" that I expect to receive from most of restaurants.We went to Auditorium 2.  Very ordinary seats which resembled me of theatres 20 years ago. The most horrible part was the overpowering smell due to non-maintenance and probably bedbugs.  May not be going again.Don\\'t trust them if you are not in Arizona. My father passed away and I hired them to clean out the house and do the repairs necessary for selling the home. I paid them, and as I live 1000 miles away, they never did the stuff I paid for. The house was not cleaned and they hadn\\'t done most of what I paid for. They charged me $2500 for the initial cleaning and repairs. Then he wanted to buy the home and tried to downgrade its value.Like many Yelpers, I was eager to try this new \"French\" bakery/cafe. It was very disappointing and probably not worth another try. There are way too many good restaurants all over Chandler. I ordered a bowl of French onion soup and the turkey/Brie sandwich. My husband ordered a Caesar salad and tomato soup. The food was basic. Nothing special to report. The French onion soup had a minute amount of unmelted cheese on the top. Longhorn makes a nice French onion soup FYI. Let me echo the sentiments of previous reviewers. The place is pretty and expansive. It was nearly empty on arrival last Wednesday 4/11. There is a set up for two lines: take out/ bakery on the right and dine in on the left. A staff person came up and told us we could sit down, look at our menus and then order. Once we were ready, there were some staff behind the counter but no one near the registers. The same girl materialized and took our order and then we paid her. She screwed up and just put me down for a cup of soup. Screwing up orders is a common theme among fellow Yelpers. It took a very long time to get our food. In the meantime, we watched the creepy manager in the purple shirt pass his number to a girl who appeared to be friends with the immature staff \"working\" there. I use quotes because the group assembled wearing dorky berets appear to move at a very social, leisurely pace. Oddly, their \"bakery\" is a very small,underwhelming display case. We finished eating and had to get in line for the \"bakery\". The guy behind the counter is pretty bored with his job. He makes no eye contact. Son, I hope you\\'re focused on school otherwise get used to working at jobs that bore you, and grow a personality. Unbelievably, we couldn\\'t just order our cookie and scone, pay and receive it. Mr Misery said: \"name\". So we got to stand there while they changed the cash drawer and tripped over each other. Then Mr. Misery called our name. The cookie and scone were just okay. I cannot fathom coming here on a busy day. There\\'s just no way! There is another location opening over at San Tan in Gilbert. We may brave that one. Most likely just for coffee and a muffin though.I can\\'t stand the green valley location. I\\'ve been to the location on Rainbow and was treated with respect. The man that assisted me was professional  and kept me up to date on the progress of my repair. I decided to stop by the green valley location as it\\'s closer to my home to inquire about another repair and the woman that works the front desk was a rude b***! She had the worst attitude. Acted like I was a bother and that my repair was of no interest to her. I got so annoyed I just left. Won\\'t ever come back here. I\\'ll stick with the location on Rainbow. The broad at green valley needs to get over herself and learn some customer service.This place sucks lines are long and the people have no sense of urgency 15 minutes to process one customer and when they finish with the customer ,they walk out\\n\\nThey can pay two people to stand around and do nothing but call out numbers ...yes you have to take a number but they can\\'t staff the desk with enough people so you don\\'t have to stay in line for an hourFood and atmosphere were good but terrible service. Definitely not what you\\'d expect at this kind of establishment, and quite disappointing.I visited this location of Frederick for the first time yesterday for take out. Being promised a wait of 15-20 minutes, I found myself and others waiting for over 45 minutes. While no apologies were given, the next batch of customers were also quoted the same 15-20 minute wait. \\n\\nThe food was just okay. My chili fish was sub-par and watery, the Manchurian Pakoras were overly soft and undercooked and the other dishes were over salted and full of food colouring. Make sure to order plenty of drinks if you\\'ll be heading to Frederick, -after a single bite of anything your mouth will feel like you\\'ve swallowed a bit of the dead sea. \\n\\nIf you like shoddy, rude service and overrated food by all means head to Frederick. I\\'ve even had a more satisfactory meal at Tangerine\\'s during their lunch specials.Upkeep is kept to a minimum. Bartender is also waitress for entire bar. Happy camper she isn\\'t. But at least the owner cares. \\nHa ha.I have been a loyal Cox customer for 15-20 years. I have cable ( a big pckg.), telephone, and internet. My bill runs $300/mo. so over my time w/them they have certainly made at least $50,000.00.\\nBUT THEY TREAT MY LIKE TRASH.\\nThey sent a tech here last week who was aggressive, scary, threatening, and he refused to replace a DVR box that not only wasn\\'t functioning, but had been \"red flagged\" for all customers b/c Cox knew they were defective and didn\\'t work. He then left with my garage wide open, my phone box ripped apart, my cable boxes all over the house and my custom cabinets empty. \\nIt took 2 hours on hold and being passed around by Cox--just to get his employee i.d. to lodge a complaint.\\nI lodged the complaint last week. I was told by Cox corporate a manager would get back to me immediately. No one has called or made any contact w/ me.\\nI have now been told by another tech--who came to switch out the defective box yesterday--that the tech I had has \"Lots of complaints\". \\nIf Cox knows they have a dangerous employees out there terrorizing their customers, and damaging their cabinets and systems, why do they try so hard to protect them? It shouldn\\'t take 2 hours on the phone to get the name ( or i.d. number) of who they send to your home. \\n\\nMy attempts to talk to management about the issue have gone nowhere.\\n\\nAnd as I stated at the beginning, I am a large customer--a big account. Just imagine how they treat small accounts.Lube is cheap, but unfortunately, so are the parts. And to think I drove around my SUV for 3000 miles with the oil filter they installed. After noticing spots of oil in the drive way I took it to Eco wash auto spa where they told me the oil filter was cheap and leaking from every side. I won\\'t be servicing any vehicle here anymore nor would I recommend their services to anyone.This is the first review I\\'ve ever written on Yelp, but I felt I owed this to fellow consumers of Discount Tire.  I went in this morning to get my tires rotated.  They said I needed new tires.  They quoted me a price on a middle two star tire.  I told them I would like to price compare with Costco who are having a 70.00 rebate on Bridgestone. Let\\'s compare apples to apples.  That tire at Discount tire was 100.00 more. The exact tire. But the assistant manager also told me to take the two star tire because Bridgestone has no miles warranty?  NO miles warranty??? \\nAre you kidding.  I didn\\'t believe him.  He also tried to change his story by telling me that the two star tire he quoted me on was just as good as the 3 star Bridgestone, when five minutes earlier he said the opposite.  I told him I would think about it it.  I went to Costco and the EXACT tire has a 70k mile warranty.  I will never go to Discount Tire again, and I suggest you don\\'t too!This has been the third time and will be the last time we will go to half moon, unfortunately it\\'s within walking distance but being served crap food and getting an attitude has made the cab fare anywhere else worth it. Food is COLD and tastes like it has been sitting around, Cold greasy pasta, cold burgers, cold greasy chicken wings, stale pretzels and cheese dip that smelled fishy and rotten.  Rude staff that you practically have to chase down to order or get a check and overall horrible customer service. When you do tell them there is an issue with food they roll their eyes and disappear for ten mins only to come back with an excuse.This is a total bummer to write.  I love the concept of this restaurant.  When I was researching where to eat on our Vegas trip, this was the first reservation I made.  We went yesterday.  The food was mostly fantastic.  But the service was SO bad, so unbelievably bad, that I have to write this review.  If I was rating on the food alone, this would be 4 stars.  We went for brunch.  Got seated promptly, waitress immediately came over and told us the special and went over the menu.  Then she left without offering to take a drink order or bring coffee, she just walked away.   Okay.  So we look over the menu, decide on what we want, put down the menu, and wait.  And wait.  And wait.  Look around, half the restaurant is empty, so that\\'s not the issue.  Table next to us (different server) sat down after us, they\\'ve already ordered.  We wait.  Table next to us gets drinks.  Finally waitress arrives, takes order.  We wait.  Table next to us gets appetizer.  La la la la.  A while later, busboy bring husband\\'s drink.  Wrong drink.  Sigh.  I try to point this out to a waiter as our waitress is gone.  He tells me \"I\\'m not your waiter and I didn\\'t deliver the drink, so I can\\'t help you\" and he walks away.  Okay.  Waitress must have been alerted as she shows up several minutes later.  We sort out the drink.  We wait.  Table next to us now has entrees (remember they sat after we did, by at least 10 minutes).  Finally food shows up, appetizer arrives with the entrees...  but at least we have food.  Food is brought by server other than our waitress.  He points out the cute little jars of butter and spiced apple butter with biscuits.  I ask for jam.  He says there is none, they only have the apple butter.  I say, but the menu says biscuits are served with butter and jam.  He says \"Apple butter IS jam.\"  And he walks away.  No, apple butter is not jam and that nasty spiced stuff would have ruined these excellent biscuits, so we ate them with only butter, until that ran out.  We would have asked for more if we\\'d ever seen our waitress.  Sigh.  She finally shows up once, halfway thru meal, and asks if I want a refill on my empty cup of coffee which has been empty for, I don\\'t know, 10 minutes?  15?  Yeah, that would be awesome.  I get one refill, but never get another.  Did I mention the cup of coffee was $5?  And that it was a tiny cup and saucer type cup, the kind that holds about 6 ounces?  Yes, FIVE DOLLARS for a cup of coffee with one grudging refill.  And my complaint isn\\'t the cost - this is Vegas, I\\'m perfectly happy to pay for the coffee, but I should have been offered refills.  Even if they cost more, fine, just give me to option to have coffee during my whole meal!  The coffee I did have was good.  Like I said at the beginning, the FOOD was good.  I had the kale salad and hubby had the biscuits and gravy special, and we shared the Classic biscuits.  Very tasty.  We cleaned our plates.  Which is good because we then had to look at them for 15+ minutes.  Sitting there, staring at our empty plates and wondering if we should just walk out.  I could see our waitress spending a lot of time a table for 6 by the kitchen.  The rest of the time she was invisible.  Either way, she ignored us.  So did all the bus persons and other waitstaff.  The table next to us?  Long gone.  Sadly, part of what attracted me to this restaurant in the first place was the desserts.  I really wanted to try a couple.  But by the time our waitress finally wandered over and picked up our plates, I was visibly annoyed.  Did she apologize or acknowledge in any way?  Nope.  Did she ask if we wanted dessert?  NOPE.  She picked up our plates and walked away with no mention of dessert, then brought us our check with a pen that literally did not work as it was out of ink, and she left.  Never asked if we liked the food, or how we were, nothing.  I couldn\\'t even flag anyone else down for a working pen, we had to take our check to the front and get a pen to sign the check.  Normally I would attach photos of the food and decor, but I\\'m showing the reality of our experience.  Which really sucks because with halfway decent service, this would have been a great meal.  I would even go back, if I could be guaranteed better service.  I hope management sees this review and that\\'s why I\\'m attaching a photo of the check with the server\\'s name and number.I don\\'t get this place either!!  So, we wanted to have dinner somewhere in the Venetian or Palazzo...  the nice security guard had given us a map of the Palazzo so we could check out some of their restaurants.  We could\\'ve eaten at any of Mario Batali\\'s millions of restaurants... or Bouchon or any of the other restaurants.  My friend (who\\'s birthday we were celebrating) was to choose the place we ended up at... and she saw 40/40 club on the map and she wanted to support Jay Z since he had just gotten hitched (LOL)... so we ended up here... which was cool because it was her birthday and it was more her.  When we walked in... it was empty... it was loud... and did i mention it was EMPTY?  We were seated in the VIP lounge area which was playing the game at high volume with a million tvs all over... which would be cool if you\\'re here to watch the game.  Our waitress came and sat with us and took our order.  She didn\\'t seem like she was even a waitress/server... she talked to us very unprofessionally but not even that... it was on the verge of rude... everything we ordered, she would say \"oh you know what I heard is good... and then she would name something\"  We had put our drinks in... and she said \"oh you know what I heard is good...\" I think maybe they get more commission for having ppl order certain items because thats what it seemed like.  We had asked for water and she asked if wanted bottle or regular water... we had said regular... and she said she didn\\'t recommend it... so she never brought it out to us.  I had ordered the 40/40 Chicken Sandwich... she told me it was going to be small sandwiches which was fine by me... and she came out with hamburgers... when I looked at the reciept... it had said hamburgers... medium... which didn\\'t make sense to me either because I was never asked how I wanted my burgers cooked and it was SO not medium! It was like well well done.  It was just a bad experience eating here because of the service mainly.  It\\'s not meant to be a restaurant... Even if it is a loungey type place... it should not be serving food.  It was very hard to eat there... even if you are eating at a sports bar type place... you would not want to be eating off a table that is shorter than a coffee table and white leather chairs.  The place just doesn\\'t seem like it should be at the Palazzo... that is probably why it is so empty.  Also, in order to eat here, we had to give them our ID or Credit card... which makes sense if it was like a club and we could ditch the bill, but we were the only people in the lounge.I texted Jack for a couple of estimates. Never heard back. Ran into him as he was doing work for a neighbor and asked again about getting an estimate. Said he\\'d gotten the text but was busy and he\\'d come by in the next couple days. Again nothing. No show or call or text. Ran into him at Home Depot weeks later. Asked one last time. Gave me the same speech that he was well going to come by in the next couple days as he was working in the area. Again no contact. My advice is contact someone else for any work you need done.Zero not even 1 star wrorst experience ever . manager even told us in signs to f**k our self . after him thinking we didnt pay our bill . such a un ethical person shoudnt be there i will make sure all of my friends and family know the trash of a place . and bad managment worst experience ever !!!!!!!The food was edible and we didn\\'t get sick, but this was just a terrible buffet. Dried out, bland, and odd-tasting food was unappealing. We wasted our money on this place.Stopped by at 8PM on Friday night for a quick snack, place was locked up tight with not a soul in sight. Closing time on Friday according to the location website is 9PMThought I would give them another try... Mistake! Waited over 30 minutes when I HAD AN APPOINTMENT!  The nail tech claimed she had 16 years experience, but did a less then professional job. After the 3rd attempt to get a simple design down I gave up correcting her. Polish on my cuticle and under my nail. Uggg, hate paying for work that my granddaughter would have done better and she is 9!\\nNext time it will NOT BE THIS PLACE!They didn\\'t bother to tell me, nor does it say anywhere on the return directions to call for a shuttle from terminal 2...when I called the lady wasn\\'t not very nice...I will not be using this service again due to the poor customer service.Went multiple times.  Once I downloaded the new app and went for my free slush.  Hit \"use this coupon\" it disappeared, staff said there was nothing we can do. \\nAnother time we ordered a drink and an ice cream and people came in behind us with full meals.  We finally left after 30 minutes of waiting with no response from them.Not sure how good it is, got a coupon to try, went there, closed for a catering event. OK, tried back 3 days later, same catering sign. Hmmmm. just tried calling and no answer and no voice mail. Closed I guess.I will not be going to this barber shop anymore. Number one, they were talking shit saying some very racist things about a man and his daughter when they walked out because of there race. Secondly I was getting a haircut one day and when I was very exhausted from work one day and didn\\'t realize until I went home that I accidentally paid double for my hair cut because I had already paid on yelp. When I called the owner and let him know, he did not want to solve the issue and said that my barber accepted it as a tip. I don\\'t know what world you live in but no one pays $26 for a basic hair cut...and the fact that he is that greedy that he does not want to at least offer me a refund...Worst car dealership that I have ever dealt with. After leasing my vehicle over a month ago, I still haven\\'t received my license plates and now my temp plates have expired. When I called the dealership, they shamelessly refused to cover any travel expenses, even though it was their major mistake that I now can\\'t drive my own vehicle. Everyone I dealt with, from the salesperson Mike Redmond, to Mike Fabian in finance, to Steve the sales manager, participated in the dealership\\'s overall incompetence and were unwilling to help. Stay away!Hundreds of flys constantly fly around this establishment. GROSS! I walked out. They said it is because of the heat, yet there are no flys in other stores. The manger said they don\\'t land on the food. That is when I walked out.Candy side was amazing. However the ice cream soda shoppe had the absolute worst customer service. After speaking to a person behind the counter about being seated and telling us there was a hostess \"somewhere\" and being completely ignored by the other 3 people behind the counter I asked one of them if he was the manager. He said he was and I asked why it was taking over 10 minutes to be seated or even acknowledged. He said well we are trying to set up for a party of 25...[you only have a party of 5]. We left. FYI I bet we would have tipped better than that party of 25 kids...Came here with a group of 4, decided to come here since we were staying at Luxor.  Started off with a nice selection of sourdough breads and ordered a (overpriced?) Merlot, which wasn\\'t anything special.  Ordered the Kobe meatloaf with foie gras and truffle which was decent but definitely couldn\\'t make out any foie gras or truffle.  Bill came out to 200+ for 4.  One of the members of our group found rocks in his food and they tried to play it off as it was uncooked rice which was a pathetic lie and didn\\'t even apologize for it.  The food is way overpriced and the service is average at best. Go somewhere else if you want a good dining experience.Let\\'s start with the price gauging... Sunday before President\\'s Day is deserving of $40 for breakfast! To add insult to injury, they don\\'t tell you that you have to get your own drinks so I added a $10.00 tip to the tab. Again this was breakfast at 9:00 in the morning, the scrambled eggs were tastless, the bacon undercooked and I had to go to each designated country before stumbling on hash browns. Since I do not posess the skills to carry multiple things at once, I gathered my breakfast items then set out on the long journey to the very back of the restaurant to search out coffee. First urn bone dry, success on second urn. Grab some oj and head back to a plate of tepid food. So coffee is hot, but food is not. I feel if I did the reverse then I would have tepus coffee. Tried a plate of crunchy melon, it is Feb granted, but someone has to know as they cut it up that it just sucks. Not sure if I will stay at the Mirage again. Use to be one of my favorites, but the nickle and diming is just an insult!I\\'ve used this warranty company for years and I was frustrated with how they wouldn\\'t repair things when they were not \"installed properly\" even they did a inspection on the house before I signed up.  Now they are charging $600 some dollars to replace the water heater at my rental due to \"other costs\".  $600 is enough to buy a brand new heater and installed by a plumber!  I am switching warranty company to Fidelity Home warranty where if you get comprehensive coverage, they would repair things that were not installed property.  Hope Fidelity won\\'t disappoint me :)I honestly was disgusted by the lack of hygiene. Not only were there flies on the cookies but one of the employees flicked a fly to kill it while it was still on the chocolate chip cookie and then didn\\'t through the cookie away.... I will not be going backWent there because they say they can finance anyone. Filled out an application, waited around for 2 hrs, had to leave. They said they would be in touch. I have received no phone call or e mail and its been 2 weeks. I have left a message for the salesman as well as e mailed back twice. Still no callback. DON\\'T WASTE YOUR TIME HERE!!!TIP: DO NOT TRY TO GO IN EARLY. YOU WILL NOT GET FED ANY SUSHI IN A TIMELY MANER.\\n\\nThis review is purely based on service.\\n\\nSo I\\'ve eaten here a few times and the service is sub par. They don\\'t get your drinks quick enough and getting the attention of our server can get tricky.\\n\\nNormally, I have dinner at Teharu. Today, I wanted to try something different for lunch. Like most people, lunch is a relativity short period of time. I wanted to grab something and get out. They open 11 am so a couple of buddies and I thought we come in right at 11.\\n\\nWe walked in the door at 10:57 and nothing was on the conveyor belt. This was a bad sign already. We should have headed into NYPD for a slice of pizza. They made us wait for about 5 minutes which was reasonable. We sat down. They actually got our drink order pretty quickly since we were the first ones to arrive.\\n\\nThe older lady came back with our drinks and by that time, we have been sitting for about 5 minutes. The only thing going around the conveyor was cream puffs, cheesecake, and soda. Knowing that I had a time crunch, I wanted to place my sushi order so that I can finish my lunch and be on my way. The older lady flat out said no. \"The sushi chefs are busy\" and walked away. I was astounded. Seriously? If your hours of operations say 11 am, you should be ready to feed your customers at 11 am.\\n\\nShe came back after 5 minutes realizing what she had said. She asked 1 out of 3 people what they wanted. We order 4 plates of one roll. She came back with only 2!\\n\\nWe ended up staying 30 more minutes, attempting to get some sushi. The options at 11:30 were very limited. After sitting for 30 minutes, I didn\\'t see a single crunch roll, Philly roll, California roll, or dragon roll and we were prohibited from making requests.\\n\\nOur meal was 19 dollars and some change for 3 people. THREE PEOPLE! We were ready to get our grub on and eat some sushi and the server basically said, no, you can\\'t get your sushi right now because we are busy with opening the restaurant.\\n\\nThis was poor customer service. I requested our bill at 11:30 and it took another server 5 minutes to come back and count our plates.\\n\\nIn the end, I had maybe 3 plates of sushi. I was starving still and I took 15 minutes extra for lunch because I didn\\'t want to walk out on Teharu Sushi. I was pretty forgiving but they simply wasted my lunch hour today. I now know to never go to Teharu during my lunch. There is a high chance I won\\'t make it back in time and have my sushi!!!!! :(Don\\'t waste your time with these super unprofessional people! Whoever answered the phone doesn\\'t even use a business name or tell you who you\\'re calling and when I scheduled an appointment for an estimate they never even showed up or called. Call anyone else.I didn\\'t listen to the low reviews, I wish I did. Literally the worst. We went through two of their routers that both broke. One didn\\'t get us anywhere near the speed we were paying for, I called and chatted with multiple people before we could get a replacement router. Finally got the replacement and things seemed okay, but no it completely broke in less than a month. It won\\'t even turn on anymore. They suggested we go buy a new router from Best Buy, who btw doesn\\'t sell dsl routers anymore wtf!? They charge you ridiculous shipping prices for the replacement for their item that doesn\\'t work properly! Every time you chat with them you get different answers and they transfer you to about 10 people before they even get close to answering your question. \\nDo not use this service, it might be cheaper but not cheap enough to deal with all this BS they put you though.The waitress is so nice and friendly but for food is horrible. The service is slow. We\\'ve waited for twenty minutes for the first plates and it\\'s not even busy only another one table next to us. The sashimi isn\\'t fresh at all also has very few items. My Bf got stomachache after having couple rolls. If you look for fresh sushi place, it\\'s not the place to come to enjoy.Go to another Louboutin store. The sales lady here is very judgemental and I honestly never received such horrible service. I\\'m used to sales reps from CL to be super helpful, courteous and patient. I mean I\\'m about to spend a couple thousand dollars. I know I walked in with a jersey and some jeans, but never judge a book by its cover. Wish I got her name that way I can put it here, but she isn\\'t worth my time. I went to Crystals to buy me shoes. Go there! The sales ladies are much much nicer!!Long wait, nothing great for food, soggy wings, doughy cheese bread.  Sauces are warm and disgusting.  Crust of pizza was good but that\\'s it.  I won\\'t be back...too many other options in area.I was so excited for my sons 2nd bday party. It was aweful!! The host was everything but a host. A guest passed out cake and my husband stood at the door to hand out goodie bags. My party was from 4-6 and at 5:30 she started cleaning around people making it very awkward and guests left early. She was wearing a lower cut dress and I now have her cleavage in the pictures of my son blowing out his candles. \\nWhen I booked the party I was told that each child gets 2 pieces of pizza, they actually get 1 slice cut in half. I had 15 children and 2 babies, I was charged extra for the babies even though they never left their mothers arms. She wasnt a kid friendly person and would just hollar out that it was time for cake or pizza, getting nobodys attention I was forced to round up the kids and get them seated. She started a \"soda tab\" and they charge $1 for a can of soda. At the end of the party I had spent $100 more than planned on sodas, extra pizza and the ridiculous 18% gratuity that was added on to my bill. A $45 tip was not what I had in mind for her. When calling the owner to discuss my issue she did NOTHING to resolve it and might have well just called me a liar because she defended the host to the very end. I will not recommend TOY TOWN to anyone!! BAD BUSINESS!!!!I have Cox for my internet and live in the 92104 are of San Diego - for more than a year I have experienced a weak signal and techs have come more than six times - each telling me that the cables are outdated and squirrels eat through the coating causing a disruption in service.  They even convinced me to rent a wireless modem from them and still  the problem continues. I pay a premium price for this service and at my wits end on what to do...if anyone has a better provider please post that carriers name.  I am scheduled for another tech to come and \"fix\" the problem.  What ever happened to getting what you paid for in this world????  I had to reconnect three times to write this review.Today I was there at 7:30pm and my appetizer (Sawara shio-yaki, and an octopus dish) came at 8:30pm then my food (spicy salmon roll, chrishi don) finally arrived at 9pm.  The food was just right like any other Japanese restaurant.. Not surprising but don\\'t get me wrong.. They taste good.  But I wouldn\\'t recommend cuz it just took toooo long for the food and I was hangry.. That\\'s hungry+angry.  The other table asked for the bill as soon as their food arrived... Everyone waited avg of 2hrs to get their order.I don\\'t know how this place has so many stars, because the two times I have been it has been highly unsatisfactory. I counted and we had 5+ people check our table. This leaves plenty of room for confusion, meal and bill errors and just pure frustration. I feel that my tip is being pooled and distributed. Sorry but that is not how it should work. I would like one server for my table for the entirety of my meal. For $9 I was brought a quiche that was flavorless and the size of my iPhone 4. I\\'m serious, the height and everything. The side was fruit meaning 3 pieces of melon 1 strawberry and pineapple. Kind of lame. Typically in November fruit is not the preferred choice of a side item. The bill was wrong just like it was wrong the time before. Then you have to flag down one of the 6 people you have encountered then ten minutes later maybe it will be correct. Sorry Toast Davidson I am NOT impressed.Square fish... Ewwww... No, just no! How is this place still open??? The frozen fish from any grocery store is WAY better than their fish!!! Everything was bland and tasted like deep fried cardboard! I use to love this place as a kid... It was no where near how I remembered it! Super disappointed!This place is totally a joke. It\\'s the worst Korean restaurant I have been to. It took 10 minutes to get a drink and 30+ minutes to get your food served. We went there on a Friday night and there was only one server!! The environment is bad and the smoke is everywhere. It\\'s our first time and also the last time to dine here.Pros: Awesome ambience. Best in the fast food business.\\n\\nCons: Wish taste of the food was Indian. I had chicken biryani bowl and mango lassi. It was the worst biryani I have ever had. It wasn\\'t spicy and chicken pieces lacked flavor. Mango lassi wasn\\'t great either and lacked sweetness.\\n\\nAdvice: If you like real Indian food, avoid this place. And on second thought...if you like good food, avoid this place.This is one of the worst restaurants I have been to, the atmosphere was nice, but the food was terrible! I ordered the Mediterranean salad ($8.99) + i think $2.49 for added chicken or shrimp, and i chose blackened chicken. My boyfriend ordered the Pistachio crusted  salmon, which he described as flavorless and that the salmon tasted like a greasy piece of fish with some pistachios thrown on top. I believe it was like $13 or 14.99. My salad was small, and oddly enough it came with a freakin muffin? Not to mention the muffin was the BEST thing i tasted in there....sad,but true, the blackened chicken was the smallest little diced cubed up chicken pieces i have EVER seen, it didn\\'t even taste as if it was blackened. The greens were wilted, and usually a $12 salad anywhere ya go is a good salad with a nice pieces of chicken cutlet, and our server was trying her  best, but came off as annoying to us unfortunately. We also ordered the appetizer of the crab fritters, i think like $5.99- and it was not great, the crab tasted old....This came off as one of those restaurants that want merely nothing but your money, the food isn\\'t authentic whatsoever and the servers look as if they could care less..I will never be coming back to this placeThe worst Lodging experience ever - If you are interested in a perfect lodging experience, you will not get it here. It is one step up from going camping. The total cost we paid for the night was $75.00.  You get what you pay for and that is not an insignificant fee, which should have been $35.00 for what we got. Because they were rude at check in and after I had a confirmed or booked reservation, you would think I could just show up with a fully documented experience....NOT!  \\n\\nThey had no reservation for me and when I showed them my confirmation, the confirmation number and supporting documentation, they simply told me it was not their problem and to call Priceline.  I asked them if they could match the cost and by the grace of God, they did after I argued the price down to the confirmation price.  I booked two beds and they gave me one, however, I was with my 90 year old dad who hadn\\'t gone to a hotel in 20 years. I needed a second bed, which was what I booked.  Luckily, after a 45-minute wait in the lobby and after they told me that I was hassling them and to go find another hotel somewhere else, another disgruntled guest decided to pack up and leave his room.  That is the room I got and at 10:30pm my options were limited without further inconvenience.  Motel 6 next door was sold out for the night and getting back into the car would have exaserbated the negative evening. \\n\\nI would have left, which is what my father suggested we do.  His position was, we don\\'t have to kiss any one\\'s a** to take our money.  During my wait in the lobby, three other guests came in and their reservations were not listed on the registry.  Clearly there is a problem with their methodology.  We booked on Priceline and show them the receipt.\\n\\nAt the Skylight Hotel / Motel you get nothing. \\n2nd rate\\nWhile waiting, at least three people who made a reservation, the front desk had no record of it.\\nThey could give me a better room but I had to pay extra for it.\\n\\nHe told m to take my money and go elsewhere\\nHe told me that I was hassling him\\n\\nThe had NO - Iron\\nThey lacked human Courtesy\\nAccommodations we fair once you got into a room\\nThe Rudeness offset all positive attributes\\nAfter advertising free Wifi -There was no free Wifi because the front desk to me it doesn\\'t work all the time and now was one of those times.  That was one of my deciding factors on staying at this hotels.\\n\\nThe worst thing is that I wanted my 90 year old father who never goes to a hotels to have a pleasant experience.  He didn\\'t. His reply was, \"I knew I should have stayed at home.\"  \\n\\nThe Indian manager was the problem, but the receptionist was nice which was the only positive thing about this hotel.So the place is very clean and the people were nice but in my opinion completely overrated & over priced. I ordered a small almond milk tea and a plain diamond bar with no toppings and it was almost $10. The tea was watery and I finished eating my bar before the tea was even made-there was no line and no one waiting \\u200d no idea why it took that long. The diamond bars are ok-had the coconut , the flavor was decent but it\\'s not anything I can\\'t find cheaper somewhere else. The boba tea choices are also very limited as opposed to other places that have many options and toppings and mixers. So the experience wasn\\'t bad-except for the 20 minutes it took to make a small tea, but with a lot of other tea places around this area this place doesn\\'t really have anything to make me want to come back.Total: $81 for 3 people\\n\\nWe, myself and two family members came in on a Sunday night. First red flag the place was completely empty at 7:00pm. The restaurant was recommended by a close friend so we decided to give it a fair chance.\\n\\nRoti Telur: 8/10- tasty and authentic (my favourite of the night)\\nYoung chow fried rice: 6/10- nothing special, bland\\nSingapore fried mee hoon- 7/10- flavourful, but not many shrimp (2 in total)\\nLamb Rendang; 5/10- taste of curry not bad, quality of meat was terrible\\nSizzling chicken: 7/10: tasty but small portions of meat\\n\\nFor desert we chose the fried banana Grenade, which was absolutely terrible. The bananas were not ripe and the oil in which they were fried had a disgusting aftertaste, indicating it was old oil. We were very unimpressed with this dish.\\n\\nOverall, especially with the terrible desert and a meal that was $81 for 3 people- this was unsatisfactory.Maybe the big name in Vegas\\' Strip negates consumer experience, but I still get to review it. We walked in because of a \"free chocolate tasting\" sign. We sat on stools in the back only to be quickly ushered off of them for the tour visitors. That\\'s fine/fair. But telling us we \"have to leave\" could have been done more delicately. Offering samples is usually in the hopes of garnering purchases by enlightened costumers, maybe in wrong. We perused the extensive assortment of candies, a lot from outside of Vegas (and the store) , and found the Hexx bars costly without first sampling what you\\'ll be buying or understanding the craft behind it. When the stools emptied, we sat down to disinterested female employee who had to be prompted for samples. We had to ask for the name of the chocolate after each sample, answered in quick snippets between chatting with other employees and in the computer. Finally frustrated with my 1 sample and my husband\\'s 3 samples after much prompting, we left without purchasing any of the chocolate. We weren\\'t sure what we sampled and were disappointed with the experience.Think of the name of the restaurant as an oxymoron and you\\'re on the right track.\\n\\nDisgusting food, cheap ingredients, unfriendly staff, and pathetic dining area.  I lived on this food when I was broke 2 years ago and I regret it, I\\'d have rather gone into debt.Dear Chef Bruell,\\n\\nIt\\'s time to come around to Parallax and check in on the dishes coming out of your kitchen. I\\'m serious. I even signed up for yelp to write this review just because I was THAT disappointed in the meal that I just had tonight. Yes, that\\'s right, this is my first ever review - my apologies that it is a negative one. Since I have had many many wonderful meals in Cleveland that I could rave about - and will, just to even it all out. First off, we had salads, I was informed after receiving the goat cheese salad that it is your best selling salad. I can see that, but not to my taste. I had to really adjust to it - it was sweet and overdressed. The goat cheese itself was delicious - but who can go wrong with breaded and fried goat cheese? Still, are the cranberries and candied walnuts really necessary? To be really frank, everything tasted that way - overdone and over-thought.. My partner had the beet salad, it was dusted with blue cheese - there were a few large pieces - but most of it was this sort-of dandruff of blue cheese. It really looked terrible. The flavors worked together fine, though nothing special. Then the main entrees came and that\\'s when the real trouble began. I ordered the swordfish. I\\'m still looking for it.  It was like a weiner schnitzel of fish - sashimi size. Poor swordfish. And technically it wasn\\'t \"stuffed\", rather it was rolled. The stuffing was supposed to be crab and corn - it was more like breadcrumbs and a few kernels of corn. I honestly couldn\\'t find the crab. Nor could I taste any of what was supposed to be in the dish because there was a ladle full of red pepper \"soup\" over the entire dish. Oh! and lest I forget the chard - overcooked and more like canned vegetables at the bottom of the plate that had been stewed to a point of mush. My guest had the walleye - where was the middle of it? The pieces of fish were literally two fingers in width. I\\'m not sure it\\'s even legal to catch walleye that small. The fish was cooked perfectly - which is more than i can say for the swordfish. However, we did not order corn chowder with a crouton of walleye. The beans were the best part of the dish. How sad. \\n\\nI can\\'t emphasize enough what a terrible meal it was. I\\'m sure there are folks out there that won\\'t understand what I\\'m saying - and that\\'s fine, everyone has different taste.  I don\\'t need big portions, and I can handle unusual combinations. But nothing worked, and I felt overcharged for a meal that I didn\\'t enjoy at all.  Truly your restaurant is currently completely over-rated. I hope you (and readers of yelp) take this to review to heart.DO NOT GO THERE...GO TO TO AN ER OR THE URGENT CARE JUST 3 BLOCKS NORTH of them.  The actual MD\\'s are OK for basic stuff but are questionable on other things.  Their OFFICE STAFF ARE RUDE AS HECK!!!  Not helpful, really pushy, and think their XSHTX doesn\\'t stink because they are on power trips.  Do not give these guys any of your hard earned $$$ unless you are in a super bind\\n\\nIf you are the owner of this practice, please fire all of your office staff in Gilbert and you may make it in business before you guys lose all your customers.  Hire some people that care about children and the parents that are working so hard to make the kids comfortable while we wait for up to 2 hours sometimes. your office staff don\\'t care about the children and give parents a hard time.I got the unlimited wash and went to use it my first time today. We got back from a long road trip. The fast pass didn\\'t let me through, so it took about 10 min to get into the wash. Not a biggie. I figured it was just a glitch. After the wash, my car still had tons of bugs on it, so I was going to go through again and the guy told me it was once a day. I explained to him that unlimited means unlimited, but regardless my first wash didn\\'t clean my car. The way he responded was not the customer service I would have anticipated from a new business. It may have been an off day, but if it continues I will cancel my pass. I am not planning on washing my car every day or even every week, but it seems like if the car doesn\\'t get clean on the first run through they\\'d automatically send you back through.Have to vent about this place.\\n\\nThe food is fine.\\n\\nBut if you ever book one of the private rooms at this place, be prepared if they give away your reservation to another group that they think is more important than you.\\n\\nWe booked the large private room for our wedding rehearsal dinner 3 months in advance.  Then approximately 1 month before the date, the restaurant called and asked if we really needed the large room because another group wanted it and whether the small room would suffice.  I told the restaurant yes, we need the large room.\\n\\nThe night before the wedding rehearsal dinner, we called them to confirm our reservation.  They told us that we were in the small room.  I then got into an argument with them about it and they apologized but said the group that wanted the large room were regulars.  \\n\\nMaybe that\\'s how you do business in Korea, but that shouldn\\'t be how you do it here in Canada. \\n\\nAnyway, we cancelled our booking, got a room at the other Seoul House (different owners) and have never been back to this one.Wish I could give a proper review about the food because from what everyone else is saying this place is great.\\n\\n\\nPlaced an order over the phone and confirmed my price.\\n\\nGo to pick it up and went from $40 to $50.  Explained that wasn\\'t what I was quoted over the phone and got the \"let me get my manager\" line.  Wait a few minutes for that person to come back so they can tell me the manager is on their way.\\n\\nI have better things to do than to wait for someone to renegotiate my price with me.  Left the food there and walked out.  Really REALLY wanted to try this place.  Oh well....Went for valentine\\'s dinner and as mentioned in other reviews, the tables are very close to one another making it not romantic at all. The waiter was the most rude person I have ever met, he has no business being in the service industry. \\n\\nFirst offense: The salads that came out were not the salads we ordered. I didn\\'t want to complain because the salad I had in front of me looked good but my husband\\'s did not so he decided to tell the waiter. The waiter promptly took our plates and gave them to another table across the room. Unfortunately this happened after I had taken a bite of my salad. Thankfully I noticed what had happened and warned the recipient of the used salad before they dug in. When the manager came over to ask about the situation he made no apology and somehow found nothing wrong with giving someone a salad touched by someone else. Then this same situation happened to the table sitting next to us. \\n\\nSecond offense: Upon receiving our main course my husband asked if the waiter could describe the dish (partly because he was worried he would have the same switch-up happen) and the waiter just replied with \"food.\" Looking back on it, this would have been a funny response had I been in a fast food chain and not pay $270 for a below par meal. The food was average and nothing special. I would never ever go back and feel that I was robbed.I have no idea how the food tastes. We were here for over ninety five minutes and all that arrived were my finance\\'s dinner and his appetizer. My food never arrived and fully thirty minutes after telling us it was given to another table (that complained because I made a modification), I still wasn\\'t given anything. At that point, I cancelled my order. His meal came without soup and salad, so I did request he get those sent, too. Then it was another fifteen minutes for the bill and still fifteen minutes later, we were waiting for our change. At that point, I requested the money back, put down the exact amount including tip, and we left. The server was running around, and it was clear that the problems were in the kitchen. Our meal should have been comped. We will never be back.There are approximately 60 CHANNELS dedicated to nothing but infomercials! Combine that with all the commercials that will interrupt your show on all the other channels and ask yourself - and maybe DIRECTV - why YOU are paying for cable at all!Not good. Maybe we\\'ve been spoiled by the spectacular Indian buffet in Niles, OH. This was so disappointing. Selection was sparse, salad wilted. Food that was there was only ok. Naan was burned and when gone no more was brought. \\nStaff mostly absent and unfriendly. \\nOverall very sad. Not sure where the good reviews came from. \\nFind somewhere else to go.I waited for probably a good 10-15 mins for them to even start cooking my food. They were standing around on their phones before the girl who took my order realized they hadn\\'t started it yet. They never came to tell me I\\'m sorry or to tell me it will be right now. The customer service was shit and I\\'m incredibly disappointed in their professionalism. Im in the service industry I know what good customer service is and this place does not have it whatsoever.Do not go! I went in for hilights and a cut and between the student and her teacher, no one could get it right. My hair turned WHITE from over processing it (she took way to long after the foils) and then after the terrible hilights were finished she told me they had to leave soon so she wouldn\\'t have time to cut my hair! She didn\\'t care that I wasn\\'t happy or offer to do anything. I don\\'t remember her name but she was Asian and petite. I do NOT recommend her or the school at all unless you want to risk a horrible job, wasting your day, and being rushed out with a bad attitude. I\\'d rather pay much more for someone with some experience and class. You definitely get what you pay for going to a beauty school versus a real salon.On hold for 45 min till I gave up;  want us to use their site which isn\\'t working.. noticed they are canceling so many flights,  allegiant you are on your way out!!\\n  AdiosI highly do not recommend coming here due to the fact that my hair was not done the way I asked for and I was left with two large highlights in the front and my natural dark color in the back. I was so angry that after she was done I had to leave. I then came back because she needed to fix it and while she was fixing it she was being rude and telling me how I told her the wrong thing even though I showed her pictures of how I always got my hair done. I now have to go somewhere else to get it done professionally to fix what she did wrong. Bad service and I will not be coming backI am so happy to have finally found a place to rant about the Venetian.  They do not make it easy.  I\\'ve lived in Las Vegas my entire 37 yrs of life.  This is the second worst buffet I\\'ve ever been too.  (The absolute worst was South Point hotel and casino)  One 11 yr old, one 12 yr old and one 4 yr old and myself were $97. (4 people)  It was $18 for my 4 yr old son and he only ate the mashed potatoes.  The entire salad bar is about 4 feet long.  There was NOTHING to choose from.  At each station there was as little as 3 items.  The entire area is so dark, you can hardly see what you are eating.  They are so proud of their crepe station though.  Unbelievable.  They should be so ashamed of themselves.  They do not even come close to comparing with the Aria, Caesars Palace, or the Rio.  For the same price, I would have gotten a TON more selection.  I couldn\\'t even bring myself to eat my pathetic salad that I had just paid a fortune for.The place is clean and costumer service is great, but if you are looking for the traditional Mexican elotes stay away from here. The corn is sweet and has no flavor. The Cheetos are not even spicy at all. Too much cheese and no lime at all. It\\'s ok if this is your first time trying the traditional Mexican corn, but if you are use to the soltero keep your 6 dollars and find a real elotero.\\nThe mangoneadas are too sweet. Needs more tajin and chamoy and lime. They literally only put a couple of spoons of chamoy. Need to be more generous with the flavors! I guess it takes a real native to make these tasty foods!!!!Never go here. Lifted my napkin to put it on my lap and a cockroach was underneath. Can\\'t imagine what the kitchen is likeDidn\\'t care for our square fish or the sauce. Both of us ended up feeling and getting sick that night.  I won\\'t be returning.  I don\\'t understand the appeal at all.Currently at the airport awaiting my flight....went over to this restaurant because my flight is at D8. The waitress is the nastiest/tidiest individual I have ever met in my life. We politely asked the male waiter if we can seat ourselves and he said yes. We sat down and the waitress saw us and said she\\'d be over soon. We grabbed menus from the table next to us because we only had 30 min before boarding. The waitress throws menus on our table and says with a nasty aggressive attitude \"patience is a virtue\"....so rude. Excuse me??? We got up and left. Don\\'t waste your time here it will only aggravate your tripused to be the only place I would eat tacos. Just got take out and the tacos are sopping wet and have a previously frozen taste. I would rather pay twice as much for taco bell. I ordered extra bean dip in LIEU of salsa and still got salsa.Usually I come in to Zupas to eat my soup and salad but since they don\\'t have anymore blood orange vinaigrette for your salad anymore don\\'t bother coming if that\\'s your favorite salad dressing just letting you know this will be my last time here maybe I\\'ll try Panera and see if they have blood orange vinaigrette next time but this is off the list for nowThis was one of the worst experiences I\\'ve ever had at a hotel. I booked a king room for 3 nights for work. I decided to extend my reservation by 1 night and tack on an extra night before my original reservation started. I booked the extra night through a 3rd party website. I assumed I would be able to link reservations when I got there. When I got there I was told that I could not stay in a king room the first night because I booked through 3rd party website. I asked for a manager and was told that a manager was not available and would be 20 minutes. 3 minutes later a manager showed up. I was told that no king rooms were available even though we could see that king rooms were available when we looked on the hotel website. When we finally got up to our room the carpet was completely wet. Please consider staying elsewhere if you are visiting this area. Customer service is not a priority here.Just got a haircut from here, showed a picture of Jensen Ackles as a reference for my hairstyle, my stylist was extremely rude and purposefully cut the top of my hair using a size 1 clipper (which is basically bald) because she was impatient with the fact that I was being picky about how I wanted my haircut. At no point in time was I rude, so this isn\\'t a spite induced attack at the store, the store manager even agreed with me. But in all honesty I\\'m extremely infuriated because it seemed like the stylist (some Philipina woman) was out to spite ME for being picky like I dont have the right to be about my own hair. Xis is my usual stylist and does a fantastic job you should definitely go to this location for his quality haircuts and the others, but that one particular stylist should never be apart of anything customer service related whatsoever due to her impatience, lack for empathy, and unaccountabilty of her actions. Now I\\'ll have to wait a good month or two before even considering to style my hair the way I want it. Thanks Great ClipsSounds like things haven\\'t changed. Bad service bad attitude. Just close for F\\'s sake.I have patronized At Your Service for over five years; first for their specialty dog food and then for grooming services. I appreciated their input on food, as I have had two dogs with special dietary needs. One needed a gentle food due to pancreatitis and one has a wheat intolerance. This store had all the options, knowledgeable staff and fair prices. \\n\\nThen I adopted a new puppy that needed to be groomed and I was at a loss, because my previous dogs never needed to get their hair cut. It was easy for me to bring my baby in, because I trusted their opinion and judgement regarding food options. There has been a couple of groomers that have worked at AYS and they were all fine - I am very specific about my expectations for a hair cut and I felt comfortable leaving little girl at the shop. My girl is a bit skittish, nervous and does not like new people so it was important that I felt this was a safe environment for her. Up until 3/8/14, I thought AYS was that safe, comfortable spot.\\n\\nOn 3/8/14 I had an appointment to get my girl\\'s hair cut and groomed. I was told over the phone it was a new groomer. Although I had really liked the previous groomer, we gone through this before and I still willing to take my girl to the same location.\\n\\nHowever, when my husband and I approached the grooming section in the back we could hear all the dogs barking/howling - there were at least four. When walked in, we were greeted with an accusatory, \"You have an appointment?!?\" After I confirmed that we did, the new groomer did not believe us and stormed to the front of the store to \"check.\" At that point red flags were raised. With all the dogs upset and this rude woman, I told my husband my instinct was to leave this place as fast as possible. He wanted to wait and see what she said. She came back five minutes later and stated, \"I am really busy today. But if you want to leave your dog, I will do it.\" UMMM, NO. We ran out.\\n\\nIf this is how we were treated and we are adults that can share and verbalize - how does she treat animals that cannot? I love my dog and I would never leave her with a woman that so obviously did to deal with us but would - as a favor. \\n\\nI will not be visiting AYS again and I am desperately trying to find the previous groomer.This is the only Starbucks that charges $3.80 for espresso regardless of whether you get a double, triple or quad shot. When I asked about the price. The barista,Jennifer, said she didn\\'t make the rules, that was just the price & to get out of her way. Poor service & exceptionally high prices. This Starbucks is not good.I took my car in for just an oil change they asked if i wanted my tires rotated so I said sure. With the oil change they are supposed to top off all my other fluids nothing else was topped off my alignment is now in awful condition. They tired to take advantage of me because i am a female. I was not please with my experience there at all.Just waited 25 minutes for an ok burger and chewy fries. \\nNo apology, no explanation. No reason to do that again.If I could give this negative stars I would! Dead cockroaches in the bathroom and a blood stain on the blankets with holes in it, broken furniture and stains on the couch! How on earth is this place $60 a night! Not a family place that\\'s for sure! Gross is definitely an understatement for this place. I have no idea how they have an A grade\\nUPDATE: after getting changed to a different room, my husband and I were woken up by someone opening our door and security threatened to call the cops on us. I went to the office and the employee laughed because she forgot to update our room number and didn\\'t even apologize and still would not give us a refund!Deplorable service.  Handful of occupied tables and plenty of wait staff, yet it too forever to get our beverages and even longer to get someone to take our order.  Yet our waiter had time to stand and talk to people at another table for over 15 minutes. Finally another server took our order. The waiter came over to apologize and told us they were \"slammed\".  Seriously?  After waiting another 30 minutes for our order, we gave up and left.  We invested 45 minutes for nothing.Went in on a Friday  night at 7:30 pm to get carry out out we\\'d called in. Waited for more than 5 minutes for the gal with the long black hair tending bar to acknowledge us. She said \"no, that\\'s not your carry out\" and walked away. The customer in front of us in line was disappointed that her  order was not filled as expected. The older gentleman employee insisted she\\'d called  it in incorrectly - and and walked away in A huff. A guy standing behind me in line says \"I\\'m a regular here and have never seen such rudeness here by employees.\" The three of us nodded and commented that we\\nHoped the regular staff was on vacation. I\\'d brought a friend visiting from out of town and was sincerely embarrassed.Worst service ever.  I\\'ve never had any issue with getting a hot fudge with a love it... even when i go to corporate in scottsdale they do it with no problem.  \\n\\nTables were dirty, one of the staff didn\\'t know how to make several things. \\n\\nSide conversations about customers when they dispute a problem. Stock items on counters where food is.worst japanese i ever had. they will not survive in japan, ny nor los angeles. not even a few days.\\nhave no clue what sushi and japanese is supposed to taste.\\n\\nkintaro is way better than them. \\ni would never pay to eat crap like this.As her name states Ms Con.  She is very deceptive and misleading. Stay away from this con artist. Find an alternative attorney to represent your case or self help center is very resourceful & many other options to consider. She\\'s a very weak communicator and does not have the ability to get matters resolved (why get it resolved? Not in her best financial interest as its passive income for this pathatic attorney). Lousy attorney at best to have an your side , unless you\\'re trying to get defeated in court.  I do not recommend her to my friends or family at all ! Besides being extremely rude she lacks empathy, she knows it\\'s a one-time gig , go for the throat! I paid her  $27,000 for my child custody case in a one year period. I\\'m in  financial ruin and have to file bankruptcy. The cherry to top it off, Karen Connolly put a lien against my house(100% prime evil ) Thanks a lot!  Finally,   I received an email from the attorney demanding me to remove my YELP  review otherwise she will SUE me for defamation. Positively the truth will prevail. God knows how many other clients you\\'ve taken down this unfortunate route. Your unethical practices will be revealed. As I\\'m writing this YELP review I\\'m bringing awareness to this situation and releasing the shenanigans. CASE CLOSEDTerrible service, ordered a qtr pounder , 5 min in drive thru get to window told wait in number 4 , just a simple burger! Avoid this McDonalds, not even sry for wait !LA Fitness just stole my money yet again...they give you a big lie when you start then trick you at the end of your membership and say you never canceled...they do zero customer service...LA Fitness sucks and they are THIEVES!! Don\\'t go to #lafitness Southside LA fitness is dirty and they are money hungry.The food was really bad! It was too expensive!! 180 for 2 people. Not worth it. Also the customer service was awfulNot getting it right the first time. Just over a month since Alaskan was out for a very brief, expensive visit and a/c has stopped working again. I contacted Alaskan and got the run around about the 6 month warranty that supposedly came with the repair. I cleaned the coils and noticed an oil leak from unit. Contacted another company (review to come) and they were very thorough and offered clear descriptions and pictures of leak on copper tubing. This other company found this problem for under 75 bucks and didn\\'t try to sell me a repair with a useless warranty. Am now considering repair vs replace. Keep looking, there are many companies on here without the negative reviews and canned responses.\\n\\nSee automated canned response to negative reviews below. Why would a company that you\\'d want to hire need this?Went here tonight, will never be back.\\n\\nThe food is typical bar food, nothing too extraordinary, I already knew what to expect from previous visits. But the service was beyond bad.\\n\\nJust an obvious example of poor training and poor management. Our poor server was obviously sent out to the wolves and had never served before.. (mind you she had 2 tables.) \\n\\nThe most annoying part, was that the manager literally went to the table in the middle of the restaurant, SAT down with them, and explained that this server was new and had messed up stuff earlier.. I could hear the entire conversation. How unprofessional can you be? I understand we were at a \"sports bar\" but to throw your own employess under the bus is just messed up. \\n\\nNot only that but why couldnt they maybe come around to every single table (3) and see if they needed anything? Or maybe HELPED out your servers rather than needing them to go and find you while you are outside smoking? Ridiculous.\\n\\nId like to be able to say \"Oh it was a busy night I understand.\" But this was obsurd, at one point I even went to the bartender to ask for my sons water (The server brought out all the alcoholic beverages BEFORE bringing my sons water) And the bartender gave me a look like I was asking for her to do backflips, told me she didn\\'t have \"To go cups\" and rolled her eyes.\\n\\nThis place obviously doesn\\'t work as a team, and it shows..\\nNever mind the crappy food, dont go here just plain and simple because the service absolutely sucks and the management and other employess obviously do not care how their restaurant is portrayed.One star for Joannes customer service tonight. The line to the registers is six people long and growing and One very exhausted looking cashier is working. Another employee just wandered up oblivious to the growing line and got on the phone. When someone asked the cashier to call for more clerks she said she can\\'t until the other gal gets off the line. She hung up the phone and continued to ignore people walking right past her to the growing line. I put all of my stuff down and walked outMy wedding party picked their tuxes up here, they were measured in AZ, GA, and FL and all at different stores.  Somehow, with 7 different tuxes, not a single tux came in sized correctly.  This store was able to resolve the problem but they were rude about it.  Additionally, my husband lost his phone in the store.  We called three times and also stopped in when we returned the tuxes and they told us they did not have it and that they had scoured the store.  As soon as we returned to Arizona they called to say they found our phone but refused to mail it because they did not want to be responsible for it.  My entire wedding party swears they will never use Men\\'s Wearhouse for anything ever again.Smells like a sewer especially around little cesers pizza that\\'s where the oder gets strongerWe dropped our 1997 expedition off to have the transmission replaced.  I had already changed the filter and gasket transmission needed to be replaced.  They returned it a week later we made it less than 25 miles before the transmission went out completely I climbed under to find the exact same transmission in the truck.  The torque converter and Trans are still original.  Truck is now stranded in the middle of the road.  Oh did I mention they charged 2005 dollars for this service.\\n Update- they refused to acknowledge they put the wrong transmission in the truck.  Verified with United transmissions that the wrong one was installed.  George was unwilling to warranty work that wasn\\'t completed.  Horrible service.  Will make it my mission to get this company closed down and removed from dmv.  Also refused refund and it has been less that 16 hours.So...no. Just...no. Before I picked up a plate to start in on the food, I noticed a roach on the buffet. I alerted a waitress, who acted as if it was nothing new, and she removed the tongs the roach was crawling on. Sadly she did not remove the bread the roach had been crawling on before it made its way to the tongs. I quietly walked back to my seat to retrieve my belongings and exited the establishment. I will be calling the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District to log a complaint and make sure they follow up.Waited 20 minutes to order and 30 min to get my drink.  Employees running like chickens with no head.This specific location is absolutely terrible. Worst customer service, very slow and unorganized.Business travel is hard enough, and finding healthy options at the airport are almost impossible. Decided to get Swiss Chalet, but very disappointed with the service. These people are definitely not happy with their job. The women behind the counter had attitude and were too busy gossiping about their personal lives.  I tried to be polite and courteous but not even a smile. Will never be going back to a Swiss Chalet period!There was a party of 6, we were well accommodated with plenty of space. \\n\\nThe food wasn\\'t hot. I like my breakfast food to be hot. I ordered french toast, and I definitely had better. I also ordered tea, and the water was luke warm. I did ask for another, and that came out hot. \\n\\nThe server was not generally responsive to us, and overall the food was sub par. Skid this location.Horrible. Slow service, inattentive staff, and terrible food. NYC bicycle (gin drink) was super bitter. Fish was greasy and chips were floppy. You\\'ll probably eat here because it\\'s the only sit down place in the terminal, but hopefully this review will have helped you mentally prepare for the worst airport food you\\'ve ever had.Today was my first trip dress shopping. I went alone, as my family and friends live out of town. I found a dress that felt like the one, BUT I just couldn\\'t say yes. I wanted family with me for that moment. I probably would have gone back for it, however, as I told Shae, who was helping me. As I was walking to the front, I overheard someone who looked like the shop manager (short bob haircut, older woman) telling Shae, my consultant, that if someone isn\\'t going to purchase a dress, that person should take it off and leave. I was crushed. It was humiliating enough going dress shopping alone, but to hear that on my way out? Though that dress felt like the one, I will not be going back for it. I will not be giving Brilliant Bridal any of my business. I am so incredibly disappointed with my experience.No excuse for lackluster treatment of customers! Being under new management, late night out partying??? What ever the reason customers should always be offered a slice of bread the way I understand it.  Yes there is a tacky reminder at the door re: did you use your punch card.I wouldn\\'t even come here if I were DEAD!\\n\\nWhile every family will need a mortuary service at one time or another, I would not suggest coming here because the experience will be somewhat mixed for the grieving family.  Yeah, you get a bunch of information about what they can do for you, what you can do, when you can say your goodbyes, etc... but man oh man, the experience is pretty much like the negotiation room at a car dealership.\\n\\nRichard Giffe, who works with the customers is very informational but trust me, it\\'s downhill from there.  He was ridiculously insensitive when asking questions about the deceased and talked really loud AT us, not to us.  \\n\\nI unfortunately have had to meet Richard more than once.  At my uncle\\'s funeral last year, he stood at the podium and said \"I don\\'t speak Chinese but I do know sweet and sour pork\".  WTF?!\\n\\nIf you unfortunately need a mortuary, skip this place...  Don\\'t believe me? Check out this article in the Arizona Republic.\\n\\nhttp://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2008/05/18/20080518priceofdeath0511.html#commentsJust came out of this store.  Customer service was the worst experience I\\'ve had in a long time.  Three employees were standing at the register chatting for the 20 min I stood looking at small tvs.  No one came to ask if I needed help. I did have a question and had to go find them to answer a question. They acted like I was disturbing then. \\nWon\\'t be back to this store.Not recommended at all. The service is disappointingly poor. I found dried shrimps and chicken feet in my order. I ordered shredded pork but instead I received the items above. I fought for a refund, which I received after a lengthy argument with the management. The management was being aggressive, rude and made racist comments regarding my ethnicity. The food got delivered one hour later after being ordered. The other dishes were cold, blend and tasteless. The food was definitely not worth the price of purchase. I would not recommend anyone order from or dine at this restaurant.Wrost service. Not a customer friendly restaurant. Limited quantity. Additional charges even if we ask for more chutney or sambar. Had to wait 20 mins for bill.If I could give 0 stars I would. My order was messed up twice (which i was very polite about because the front counter person was new) but the manager Heather was so rude I couldn\\'t believe it. This was truly the worst experience I\\'ve ever had at a food place. DO NOT GO HERE!!! The food also was extremely average. Such a shame because I love the other locations, this one is trash because of the staffIt was amateur night at the Wolf. This theatre is old and the acts they book are miserable C level talent. Last night, a Hypnosis show never even got off the ground due to lack of customers. There were eight people in the audience and hopefully nobody paid full price or ever would for this lame show. I paid $5 as a hotel guest which was refunded at the end of the horrid attempt at putting on a show. The hypnotist said he needed 9 people and others in the audience to watch. He really had no explanation when I asked him after the show why he couldn\\'t just hypnotize two people like I have seen multiple times. This guy\\'s act relies on 9 people? What an amateur and he had that blonde spiky hairdo which usually indicates scammer. The opening act was even more of a joke. Who actually books these people. It was some dude named balloon master, who purchased some balloons somewhere and then made dirty jokes about them for about 6 minutes. He throws all his stuff into two garbage bags and tosses some penis shaped balloons into the crowd of guys. He is like the homeless guy carrying his balloons around with them in his car trunk probably. Go see a real hypnosis show on the real strip. This night was a disaster, try some promotions or get a better act cause these vtwo dudes were not off-strip ready, they were just awful.After 24 hours of waiting for word on my issue, I had to ask them what the problem was, what the plan was nd when they anticipated the truck would be available to me...All while having to read their signs on their walls all stating that they are committed to providing all of the above, within the FIRST 2 HOURS...lousy job folks...This is the epitome of terrible customer service! Furthermore, when I told the service person the symptom I brought it in for, can only be duplicated when the engine is under a load...surprise, surprise they tested it and told me they couldn\\'t locate the issue...This is because they test drove it without the engine being under a load....This place clearly believes 15 year veterans of the road, are idiots and don\\'t know what they\\'re talking about....so, it\\'s a big zero on the customer service front, and a big zero in diagnosis due to inadequate testing practices...driver beware. ..go elsewhere for your service needs if you are able to.First impressions were bad..the hallways look like they hadn\\'t been vacuumed in days.  The door was all banged up and paint was chipped.   The \"fitness center\" had one treadmill and one stair machine only.   When we opened the door we  saw stains on the carpet and a stain on our sheets.   Our room was for four with two beds and only had two towels.  \\nIf we hadn\\'t gotten in late after 14 hours on the road we would have left. \\nWould not recommend this placeShe doesn\\'t even know what a square puppy cut or s lion cut is. My dogs are a hot mess from this groomer. Won\\'t return calls regarding her crappy cuts.Not impressed at all with this location. My wife and I went here for a Sunday morning brunch and the service was atrocious. The server Julie R. was slow. She did not acknowledge us for quite some time upon being seated, did not refill our waters appropriately, did not do table checks, and seemed generally uninterested in customer service. \\n\\nWhat really bothered me is that I left her a small tip to recognize the unacceptable service (in reality it should have been zero) and she gave me a sarcastic \"thanks\" with an eye roll. Will not be back at this location again.Made an order 20 minutes prior to arrival on the app, was declined 5 minutes before closing because all employees were all sitting down at the table eating food. I was told \"we\\'re closed\", I mentioned that they weren\\'t and employee responded with \"we\\'re out of food\". So either restock on food to where it is available all day up until it actually closes, or don\\'t allow giant dinners before closing that includes every employee.My boyfriend and I booked this hotel spontaneously to take my little brother and sister out for a night just to relax and use the pool, etc. Had nothing but issues from the moment we checked in. I noticed quickly after doing so that they charged me a severe $187 for incidentals. Once I went back and brought this issue to their attention (it was a manager and an associate), all I heard back was \"hmmm I don\\'t know why that would happen...\" Nothing else. I continually asked why and when my funds would return, and with 0 care was responded with no explanation and that they should return in a few days. Later on we called room service simply asking for a couple of forks to enjoy our meal with. The lady who answered, after 3 times of me calling and no one answering said: \"Well we\\'re super busy right now so that\\'s going to be awhile\". We were never delivered the forks. I used to have her exact position at a hotel being an order taker and a server for room service. It takes 2 minutes to deliver silverware. Do it while delivering another order. Very disappointing. Finally, once checking out the next morning I asked again about the extra charge with a different associate and she was a bit more polite explaining when I would receive funds, but still with no explanation as to why this would happen. I would not recommend this hotel. There are much better ones in the area for the same price or lower.They kept insisting to cancel the reservation instead of keeping a customer. Hertz for the lose! Unprofessional and unwilling to please customers. Both managers were ridiculous but more so, the new lady was clueless. You know who she is.Choice Home Warranty assigned this company to fix my dishwasher. The technician came out and took my $65 visit fee and told me he had to order a part to repair the dishwasher. Waited a full week and never heard back from them, so I gave them a call. I was told that Choice Home Warrenty had not authorized for them to order the part. My issue is that I was never called to be informed of this nor did they follow up with Choice Home Warranty, I had to do that myself. \\n\\nI was told by Choice Home Warranty that this company had not responded to their repeated tries to get a part number from them. I had to be assigned a new company to get my issue resolved. I don\\'t think that they ever intended to repair my dishwasher and just wanted to collect the $65 in cash.Just say no. \\nFirst off, they don\\'t warn you about the roaring trains that come at all times, day and night. You hear every horn and as it passes by on the tracks. Not to mention we lived on the 4th floor and can hear people talking on the streets. Imagine what a train 50 feet away sounds like. \\nSecondly, they are so nice and really know how to sell you on the place. Then you move in and they are rude and unhelpful. Pretty much they don\\'t really care about you, just your money. We had the ceiling leak for several months, and they supposedly had someone fix it, but a couple weeks afterwards it was leaking again. No compensation whatsoever for the inconvenience, they just gave us garbage cans to put around the apartment where the leaks were....really??\\nTo top it off, one of our vehicles was a motorcycle that we had parked legally for one night with a parking pass was vandalized. Some IDIOT tried to move it into the GRAVEL side walk and DROPPED the motorcycle and broke the mirror and scratched up the whole side of the motorcycle costing thousands of dollars in damages. The apartment complex was NO HELP AT ALL once again. The \"cameras\" they had in the parking lot were \"not working for some reason\". So we never found out who the imbecile who was stupid enough to touch and move someone else\\'s property. \\n\\nAgain, just say no and find a nicer apartment elsewhere that\\'s not in a sketchy area with shady management.Do these people ever pick up the phone? I need an appointment. At this point I\\'m asking the Dr for someone else.\\n\\nDespite Simonmed trying to contact me here, I have no interest in spending money with a place that can\\'t pickup a phone. I didn\\'t have to wait on EVDI. In ten minutes had an appointment and they where nice on the phone. Simonmed. No thanksWent here yesterday April 18th nigh time. Fries were soggy with no salt and burger was burnt. So went again today April 19th night time and seriously had to write a review your staff are ffin incompetent. Behold my burger was burnt! BLACK BLACK BLACK. I couldn\\'t even Finnish the first bite. And same thing fries had no salt what so ever. And ordered another burger as well that was missing even sauce. Will definitely never come back now.I still have nothing from Natalie Pyles, Personal Trainer.  Also works out of Fitness Elements.  Amazingly, I have run into more people at my gym who have had the same scamming experience with her.  Her Facebook page is just as ridiculous as she is.  I am currently talking to an attorney about this to see what my options are.  A group of us are getting together to present something.  It is May, 2017, and still not one cent.  Check her out on Facebook, and you will see what I mean.I\\'m here to comment on the conduct of one of the tour leaders taking a group of what appeared to be mainly senior citizens on a tour through Red Rock Canyon Park today.  Their convoy pulled up into the farthest parking lot at the second parking area after you enter the park. The problem was they pulled up on to the side of the walkway right behind parked cars.  That is where my experience begins.  I was with my family and we were in the process of backing out with old people in scooters right behind our car.  It was not safe to do so but tour leader #1 encouraged me to do so.  After successfully backing out I proceeded up the narrow lane created by the convoy parked unsafely on the right of us and the series of parked cars on the left. The left hand turn I have to make is particularly narrow due to the tour leaders scooter parked in the front of the convoy.  Tour leader #2 is in front of my car and recognizes the situation he has created for me.  Rather than get in his scooter and move out of the way he proceeds to gesture his hands and arms wildly assuming the role of traffic cop.  I was distracted by what amounted to me to be an unrequested buffoon show.  As my first pass was unsuccessful rather than allowing me the opportunity to correct my angle myself this buffoon proceeds to come to my drivers side window AND PUT HIS HANDS ON MY STEERING WHEEL....again I did not request his help in any way shape or form.  Now he is asking me to move my vehicle as he commandeers the steering wheel to correct my angle.  My family is looking on with startled discomfort as though to think whats this buffoon going to do next?  He created a highly unsafe situation as a result of his buffoonery...\\n\\nAs I was leaving this buffoon decides to save his own face and announce to the convoy of disbelieving tourists that \"He Cant Drive\".... are you kidding me?  You come into my family and my life unwelcomed in the most buffoonish way, create a buffoonish situation and now try to launch a buffoonish insult to your paying customers?\\n\\nI have not taken this tour would not recommend it based on my peripheral experience and would certainly caution anyone to place there lives in the hands of a clear buffoon tourist leader.  Ruined what was otherwise a lovely family day out.I had a meeting for an estimate on June 1. Chris came to give the estimate, and was very knowledgeable. He said that he was a little busy and would get back to us after the weekend with an estimate. It is now June 29 and I have not heard anything back.This was our fave pizza place. The monster pizza had so many great toppings. But tonight.... nope nope nope. Called in an order and was told 20 min. Showed up and was told 20 more. Walked back in after that 20 and they hadn\\'t even put it in the oven. Asked for a manager and they said he was putting on sauce on pizza and couldn\\'t come out. Asked for a refund and left. Left a long line of other angry people too. \\n\\nThis was avoidable - \\n\\n1. Call people when their orders are running late\\n2. Apologize. Just once. You know, like you care about this issue. Give an explanation if you really want my sympathy or my future business. \\n3. STOP TAKING MORE PHONE ORDERS UNTIL YOU GET CAUGHT UP. Seriously. \\n4. Offer a future coupon or discount on this 60 min (!?) Order. \\n\\nDisappointing. But hey, there\\'s always the Gilert location to try!Absolutely hate it here! Management sucks, a/c sucks, loud renovation sucks. Everything sucks! Especially the infested ass facility as a whole. I\\'m over this place. Lease is up in 2 months.\\n\\nMy main concern is the water. The boiler never works! And since it is always malfunctioning we are either left to take ice cold showers or have no water at all. I work until 10 pm, so when i get home i expect to take a warm shower. Not here you won\\'t! It seems as though the hot water goes off at a certain time. That certain time i always after i get home. Its ridiculous!\\n\\nAs others mentioned the a/c and heater issue, I\\'ll mention it as well. Because they turn the boiler off and on, you don\\'t have the luxury of setting your desired temperature. For instance its been hot out lately so the heat has been y turned off until November, only cold air is available. Now that may not sound too bad, but it has been raining heavily the past couple of days. I would love to come in my apartment, turn on the heat and warm up after being drenched in rain water. Sadly that won\\'t be happening. If I\\'m cold i just have to suck it up or wrap myself in blankets because i cannot turn the heat on. Its really unfortunate!I went in to look at the Mazda CX-5 and was not impressed with the service. The sales guy was acting put out that I was even there, needless to say I took my business elsewhere.Went on the website last week and filled out a form saying please contact me as I would like to set up appt to get a quote.  Email says allow 2 business days.  That has passed.  Called this morning at 830am 6/5.  Person who answered phone said will give message to sales reps who come in at 900am.   I guess Puckett\\'s has so much business they don\\'t need new customers.  If you aren\\'t going to respond to requests via your website - don\\'t offer that option.  Not sure if the breakdown for today is due to person answering phone or sales reps.  Definitely an interesting business model. \\n\\nUpdate:  three strikes and you are out.  I decided to go by the store in person since I had no response to my yelp email request and no response to my call.   Got there approx 1030 am on a Wednesday (6/6).  There was no one in the showroom.  I stood around for about five minutes then followed the voices to the \"office area\" toward the far side of the store.  A woman asked me \"have you been helped\"?  To which I responded \"no, not yet\".  She said she would be right with me.  Ten minutes later she still did not appear.   So I have decided that they really do not need my business - right.  How many chances can I give them!!\\nSadly a friend referred them as she had such a good experience.   I could not refer this store based upon my personal experience.  My search is still on for my new flooring.  It is now 6/8.I decided to give this place a second chance after my first visit ended in extremely slow service and nearly raw eggs that made me sick. \\nWe expected slow service on this visit because it was a Holiday weekend.  After waiting over an hour for our food, we asked to speak to the manager who told us that this should be expected because of the Holiday and offered no apology.  He went back to the kitchen and advised us that our food would be out in five minutes. After waiting another 10 to 15 minutes, the food finally came out one meal short. We were offered no apology or discount for the forgotten meal and slow service. Nothing on our ticket was comped. I was super bummed and wanted to like this place, but for \"OK\" food and bad service, it is not worth it.The service by store manager was very rude. I wanted to buy something from their store that was on display and wanted to know why we could not buy the item. She was extremely defensive and I wanted to give her feedback that it made no sense not to sell something that was on display. She was very un appreciative she even said that she has so much experience as a store manager that she knew better and client feedback was unimportant.For companies who do not learn and take feedback from clients is a company that will fail. I was very discouraged from the experience.Clients who care enough to tell you are trying to make you improve. There are many stores to shop at and Muji does not have an edge I\\'ll rather spend my money elsewhere. The store manager should have better customer service and a simple \" let me take your number so we can call you when the product is in store\" is simple 101 customer serviceFirst off, love Wild Thaiger, food is excellent, service is by in large prompt, courteous, and a relaxed atmosphere. \\n\\nHowever, I had a bad experience, where I witnessed a cockroach walking across the bar in front of me. I voiced my concern to Ola, she couldn\\'t find it. But apologized. I was dissatisfied with this response and wrote her an email expressing my concerns. This is her appropriate, professional abbreviated response.\\n\\n\"As a regular you know we have an \"A\" rating because we don\\'t have a pest problem.  I will be glad to share the pest inspection reports and monthly service schedule for the last eight years which we have been in business.  It would be a perfect world if I could afford to have enough staff to open all of our boxes in the parking lot and stock all of our products individually to ensure that unwanted pests do not enter our doors. Of course we have discontinued purchasing product from the supplier and they are aware of the problem.\"\\n\\nShe refunded my money, and we\\'re satisfied, moved on. \\n\\nI show up today with my party---and she pulls me out of the restaurant, tells me that \"i\\'m not supporting her business\" and that a few days after my email she gets an inspection from the Maricopa County Health Department, and they gave her a \"B\" rating. She proceeds to accuse me of calling them, and blaming me for her low grade. I inform her that I dealt with her straight, communicated directly with her, and I considered it resolved. At this point she tells me she won\\'t serve me anymore after being a customer for about seven years.\\n\\nHaving never dealt with the Maricopa Environmental Services, I\\'m not really aware with how they schedule their inspections but clearly it was a coincidence that it occurred 6 days later. I guess Ola never thought perhaps it was a different customer, or in fact that maybe it was scheduled every 3 months?\\n\\nAt any rate her reaction to customer feedback is not only unprofessional but just makes bad business sense. \\n\\nPoor decision Ola, I\\'m really surprised your sanitation problem, and failing an inspection is blamed on your customers.Stay away!  Rip off artists.  \\n\\nI had them come to give me an estimate on some plumbing work.  The guy put on quite a show hemming and hawing.  Then going out to \"call his boss\" before coming in and giving me an estimate 5 times higher then what I got the work done for by a legitimate plumber.   I don\\'t know how these people sleep at night.I have given this place 3 chances and it still disappoints me. The food is subpar, the ambiance is terrible and the servers are rude. \\n\\nI was there a few weeks back and my friends and I after a night out were reminiscing and our waitress was the biggest snob listening into our conversation and giving her opinion.  She was rude enough to the point we almost walked out before our food, after a 45 minute wait, was even served. \\n\\nThis place won\\'t last long in old town. With mediocre food at best, slow service and rude employees there are too many other great spots in old town people will venture to.When you enter a restaurant and it has a greasy smell, LEAVE!  Today\\'s breakfast was very greasy, likely a grill that need a good cleaning and the oil smelled like it needed changing.  I\\'ll never return.Stay away. There are better Jewish deli\\'s just down Summerlin Parkway. I understand that this is just a few days after opening but c\\'mon what a mess. The place was near empty and it still took 2 hours to get our orders. I don\\'t mean complicated orders either. I mean bowls of Matzoh Ball Soup (should be quick an easy ready-to-go in vats back there), salads (again super easy), and Reuben sandwiches (again slice up some meat and slam it on some bread). They kept apologizing for how long it was taking - but offered no discounts or adjustments to the bills to reflect that apology. Also FYI the Reuben is like a $20 plate - and bland! Do yourself a favor and skip this place.I generally give every business a fair shake and realize everyone has a bad day but don\\'t waste your money here. I ordered a meatball parm sandwich and what I got was an embarrassment, there was almost no cheese and the meatballs were sliced what seemed to be in quarters but length wise and then laid on the bread, there was almost nothing on this sandwich other than bread! The worst part is it\\'s a $9.00 sandwich, if it was $5 or $6 I would understand and if I worked closer I would have brought it right back. I will say the flavor was ok at best. If you served people sandwiches like this for $9 anywhere in the northeast you wouldn\\'t be in business for long. Either lower your prices for your mediocre sandwiches or up your game to justify the price.Disgusting! Felt like I was on Fear Factor, except I paid to eat there.  Everything was funky.....taste, smell, texture. Wished I read Yelp before ordering.  Even the white rice was really odd.  Can\\'t put my finger on it, but it was like extra dense and just strange.  Have never had a Chinese place mess up white rice.  Shrimp toast was oddly large, burnt, smelly and can\\'t imagine what decade the shrimp was from.  Teriyaki sticks could have been squirrel.  So gross, threw out most of it. Oh, and it took an hour and a half. Would not eat here for free! At least I did not get maggots like a previous poster.... I think?? God help me tomorrow.We waited over an hour for our three cheeseburgers even though the restaurant was nearly empty.  When the food arrived the burgers were cold and my kids didn\\'t even have cheese on their burgers . They took them away and took ten minutes to add and melt the cheese.  The burgers were inedible at that point.  They chose to \"comp\" our sodas as an apology.  Wow.  Thanks for a shit meal and zero apologies for crap service.  Wont go back even if it\\'s a free meal.Horrible customer service, probably worse I\\'ve ever had. The cashier didn\\'t say thank you, just handed me my receipt without even looking at me. So I made her hold it till she looked at me, that\\'s when she felt like an idiot.Horrific/non-existent customer service.  Nursery men rude and sexists.  If you want tons of bad attitude and no help, this is your place.  Yesterday I decided to drive the extra mile or two (I\\'m new to town so pardon lack of distance knowledge) from Lowes to Breezewood (the one across from the Giant Eagle) Nursery.  Night and day difference.  I said to the Breezewood nursery person who gave me loads of tips, instructions and advice that they were so much better in every way from Lowes.  The man replied \"We hear that a lot.\"   \\n\\nIt showed.  Breezewood was bustling with customers (I was still in and out in 5 minutes including going all the way to the back where the bulk soils etc are).  When I drove past Lowes, it had an almost empty parking lot.  Maybe they stay in business by charging tons for bad work to unsuspecting housewives?  They sure don\\'t like people who ask questions or try to get information.  They just seem to want a customer who keeps their mouth shut and pays whatever the jerks dictate.First you\\'ll notice there is nobody eating inside.which says a lot about the food.\\nWent to use a certificate that we got for Christmas,the owner was mad at us instantly,I guess he had a falling out with the company that was selling his certificates.\\nI\\'ve had the pizza,it\\'s not that good.\\nThe owner is a azzhole!\\nPlease go elsewhere.This shop sells stuff which have already expired. I had a friend working there and he told me not to buy certain stuff like juices ... Very expensive.. Its not worth it\\n\\nIbneler, o kadar pahali satiyosunuzki, kafanizi sikiyim sizin...Stopped in yesterday for dinner. Terrible food. Very bland and not cooked enough.I have been at this Starbucks location a few times and each time I go it gets worse. It isn\\'t kept clean. You can\\'t sit on the chairs by the windows for flys and the sides of the comfy chairs look like they haven\\'t been wiped in a while let alone the floor.Horrible language barrier here. Ordered P4 and it came with Tripe (ewwwwww!!) called the server over and he said the English menu doesn\\'t specify it but supposedly the Viet version does????? How the hell does that make sense?!? He couldn\\'t even explain to me because his English was terrible. I have a shrimp allergy and from that point didn\\'t want to eat any of the other dishes we ordered because how the hell do i know if there\\'s shrimp\\nIn it or not because that menu is unreliable from that point. Egg rolls are whackkkkkk! Seems like super generic frozen brand...Don\\'t eat here. Only came here since they opened early. Searching Yelp now for another pho house because I\\'m starving!!!This was a huge mistake coming to this place. Horrible service. Can\\'t tell you how the food was, didn\\'t wait around to find out. Definitely never going back.I spent 15 minutes in the store. Young, lazy salesgirl did not acknowledge my presence nor did she offer to help me. Most likely I would have purchased several items had there been adequate customer service. There are many unique stores on Ellsworth as well as S Highland with excellent salespeople. Skip this one.I\\'ve never been to the gym, but still rating this based on the experience I had trying to even get information from them!  After my frustrations, I can\\'t foresee going there to work out.\\n\\nI\\'ve tried calling them twice, to find out about personal training costs.  Don\\'t get me wrong, both times they were nice, but I have still not received any information from them, even after giving them my e-mail address twice.  I called and spoke with a gentleman a couple of weeks ago, and he kept asking me questions, but didn\\'t seem to register my answers.  I guess he was reading from a script.\\n\\nI don\\'t like it when you ask someone what they charge for a service (which I did) and their response is, \"Well, what can you afford?\" or \"Well what is your budget?\" Instead of this translating to me that they\\'re willing to negotiate a price, I get a used-car salesman feel of, \"We\\'re willing to for you to pay much lower, but we won\\'t tell you that. We\\'ll find out what your max is, so we can push you as close to that dollar amount as possible.\" I don\\'t have a budget yet.  I\\'m sorry... how about you give me some prices, and I\\'ll figure out if I can afford it...\\n\\nThe guy also asked when it was convenient for me to work out.  I work during \"normal business hours,\" in fact later, so it would be late at night after my kids go to sleep, when someone else is at the house to be w/them, and I\\'m not an early riser/morning person, which I specifically told him.  His response was, \"Well, if you can be there at five a.m. a personal trainer can be there for you.\"  Why ask me what my schedule is and when it would be convenient for me to work out, if you\\'re going to tell me who is available when I\\'m not?  I also had my weekend fully booked for my kids\\' activities, which I also told him multiple times, indicating I wasn\\'t able to come in to talk to a manager, and that I would prefer they just e-mail me the information.  Then, w/out listening, he said, \"Why don\\'t you come in on Saturday, or Sunday, 9-2, when my manager is here, or come on Monday 8-5 when my manager is here?\"  Um.... it\\'s like I was talking to a wall b/c I had JUST said I wasn\\'t available during those times!\\n\\nI\\'m not a \"lookie-loo\", but I\\'m not pulling teeth to get info. from them anymore and now have zero desire to go in and use their facility.  If they\\'re open 24/7, they should truly be available 24/7.I called in a water leak which was coming out of the water meter box, clear full of water, and they said it would take 2 weeks to come out.   After two weeks with no calls and still a water leak I called them and they said they fixed 4 days ago.   I told them that water was still coming out of the top of the water box and they said \"well, we will schedule it again but can\\'t do anything today.   So who knows.  I feel bad for their customer reps because they must just get beat every day.   They charge you $400 a month for water and have crap service, and bitch they need another 35% increase to survive!Waiter disappeared for the whole dining experience before we even got our food. Was told happy hour appetizers were half off then they tried to charge full price.Food tasted ok but an hour after we got back into our room we were sick as dogs. Had to stay in our hotel room instead of going out that night. The next day we overheard a group of four say they were all throwing up and I asked why, surprise surprise they all got sick after eating there too. Update got home to realize they double charged us for our meal lol it just gets better and better.Ordered delivery and it never arrived after waiting an hour and a half. Tried to call the store to check the status of my order and they didn\\'t pick up the phone.Well, the I\\'d comment on the food but, it\\'s been almost an hour and we haven\\'t gotten any food yet. The music is on 10. It wouldn\\'t be so bad if they had a speaker when they call put names. But, they don\\'t. So, everyone is looking at each other  saying what did they say??  I\\'m not sure I\\'ll ever come back here again.Came in here for breakfast. Food was meh. Hash brown and sausages seemed commercial. Eggs were eggs, a bit bland. \\n\\nBut this review is about cleanliness of the restaurant. when I seated my napkin was a bit crumbled and there where some unused packets of syrup. (packets, really?)\\n\\nIt was obvious they hadn\\'t cleaned the table completely, yet the hostess just took the napkin, and I had to call her attention to the packets.\\n\\nBasically everything was ok (not good). When I was done I decided to wait a few seconds and watch them clean the table to my left. They just picked up the dishes and napkins and wiped any area that was not covered or hard to reach. Since there were to big placemats they were not cleaned or anything and all the crumbs were left on them. Also the area that the check was on was never wiped, nor the other diagonal side because that would have meant walking around the table to clean the other side.\\n\\nSo it get\\'s 1 star for less than minimum cleanliness required.should have give them zero star \\nwhat a shittty pizza we have ever eat\\nnever order from these guys.\\ndough was so rough and barely have enough cheese on pizza\\nwe even paid $20 tip to driver but actually pizza tastes sucks and not worth ordering it.\\nu guyz messed it up our dinner....The staff is so unprepared, so rude and disorganized. They have no customer service whatsoever. I have been in many different places and this is the worst of all of them. Yesterday was my wife and I first time in this place because a famous Venezuelan comedian was presenting for the first time in Las Vegas. We tried to order some the waitress and one of the staff, who was passing by, mentioned that they don\\'t have that item that we were ordering. So I decided to order something else. 30 min passed by, I went to the waitress and ask for our food, she mentioned that she would check in the kitchen, which she never did. 10 min later, passed and I ask another waiter to check on our order and no response. We decided to talk to the \"manager\" to find out what was going on, and found out that the items that we ordered were run out as well. Instead of apologizing which we would have  gladly accepted, the \"manager\" started arguing with us. Tried to talk to the \"owner\", he seemed so incompetent because he didn\\'t say a word. We understand they could have some misunderstanding but not true because at the end of the event, the staff including the manager were so eager to clean everything, that took my unfinished drink and toss it out. Again, instead of apologizing, offered another drink and let us know to move to different table, he started arguing with me. My wife and I are easy going and barely complaint much but this place is the worst of all. No customer service, the prices of everything are extremely high, food is average bar type food. Nothing impressive.I\\'m a sushi purist.  Please no fusion crap.  Very few places can pull off fusion and I\\'m sorry but you\\'re definitely not in the runnings. Serve me my fish off straight from the waters onto my rice.  Thank you sir, now get outta my way you\\'re blocking my view of the fish I\\'m going to devour.\\n\\nHuge disappointment, pricey, trendy, and mostly empty and how dare you forget my soy sauce again?  Don\\'t you serve sushi? Doesn\\'t it say that in the name of your restaurant? Even after I pointed it out to one of the servers he jokingly said, \"yah and we\\'re a sushi joint, you think we\\'d have soy sauce.\"\\n\\nGimme my freakin soy sauce!$7.59 for an unsatisfying, not thick chocolate milkshake...I don\\'t think so.  It tastes like they put half a scoop of ice cream and 2 cups of milk.  High price + low-quality equals horrible.  \\n\\nDrinks come in only one size to force you to buy the expensive one. \\n\\nThe Ben & Jerry\\'s name no longer carries value in the retail space.  McDonald\\'s has a better tasting chocolate shake than B&J. \\n\\nIf you want to waste your money come here.This place says it\\'s open till 9pm, the waitress started by telling us all the things that were unavailable on the menu. We got here at 7:45 and ordered bruschetta to start,the waitress said the kitchen was closing so she would \"see if they could make it\", she said yes, but they would have to cut everything up from scratch. Um okay. They started putting up the chairs around us, it\\'s now 8:20 mind you they close at 9, another couple came in and were told the kitchen was closed that the only thing they could have was pizza. Bad business, making your customers walk out and rushing the ones that were there.The agent Nga allowed my family to miss out on a house due to unprofessional behavior! My name was ran through public records, and it just so happens to be a very common name. Without using a middle initial pulled up multiple public records and before asking for proof submitted by my agent or myself submitted that to the homeowner who then denied my application! These public records were not even me! On top of that I followed all the instructions that were asked of me and STILL was denied due to the lack or proactivity from this agent. I am is shock at the negligence of this agent. Now I\\'ve lost a home for my daughters and myself and am stuck in a unhealthy environment with them.Read their reviews and looked up their website.  4 of us showed up today for brunch to a COMPLETELY empty restaurant.  We asked for the table in front next to the window.  Next thing we knew the rude hostess was ushering us to outside seating.  NOTE: it is cloudy and raining today.  The group consisted of 4 / 3 women in their 50\\'s and 60\\'s.  No one was interested in sitting outside on a day like this.  We again asked for the table inside the empty restaurant and she then told us that they were completely booked.  IT WAS COMPLETELY EMPTY.  I am assuming it was booked for a party or something, but shouldn\\'t you post that on your Facebook page or on your website?  It was handled poorly by their staff and especially the hostess.  WOULD NOT EVEN CONSIDER RETURNING.  Guess what folks... great restaurants are a dime a dozen here in the Valley.  We walked without even looking back.Tow truck is a dick and will tow your car if you are a resident and if you have family over be careful you might have to pay 250 to get it out of the pound. The hallways are always dirty and the kids living there are extremely loud even on weekdays. The pool area can be pretty loud. The music is always playing loudly. The staff up front are disorganized and a couple of them are rude. The printer in the computer lab was constantly not working for the whole year. Don\\'t lock your bike up outside my wheel got stolen. Very unsafe area with bums lingering around. I would not recommend living here. Although for the Tempe area it is good location wise, and the gym is pretty awesome other than that I would invest in living in north Scottsdale or an apartment elsewhere.\\nFormer resident May 2015- July 2016You know it was a bad meal when your server brings you the bill and says \"at least the bill came fast,\" then hovers over you watching you pay. Where was all this attention when we actually needed it?\\n\\nWe waited at the front for a while for a hostess. That was clue number one we should of left. We were seated and ordered our appetizers. They took 40 minutes just for 2 apps. Once they came out we then ordered our entrees so they\\'d be ready quicker. They took 30min.\\nThe reason we went to Milestones was for their steaks. We were told they were out of steaks. I ordered the chicken club. I was then told they were out of the bread but could put it on a burger bun. My boyfriend ordered the burger. Food was dismal. Burger bun was too big for sandwich.\\nThe apps were disappointing. We got the popcorn shrimp. It\\'s a brown bag (looks cheap) with popcorn, then 6 little shrimps on top. Let\\'s be real here, how much does popcorn cost? Next to nothing. They could of at least seasoned it. The fries as an app we wouldn\\'t of ordered had we known we\\'d be getting the burgers with fries. \\nWe agreed we could of gone to an actual burger place (The Works) for better burgers & service. \\n\\nHad they told us right away that they were behind in the kitchen, we could of left or been prepared. Had they told us they were out of steaks we could of left or decided to wait it out for a different meal. There was NO accommodation made to try to make up for them being out of steaks & bread. No apology. No manager came to our table to try to fix it.  We came in from the advertisement and we told too bad we\\'re out. Feels like false advertising.This is a sales review: We came for the tour and the sales rep was insistent on receiving our social security numbers. At the casino we were told to just listen to the 120 min presentation and you will receive free gifts. I have been on timeshare tours before and was never forced to provide a SS #. The sales rep was very persistent even after we told her no, no, no from the minute we sat down. As a result we received our entire deposit back plus the ATM fee and 2 coupons to a restaurant at the Flamingo. The worst sales experience and waste of a day!!I was a member for years but without a large household to supply, the warehouse store has lost its appeal.  The one thing that kept me going back was their deals on tires.\\nYes, you can save a few percent on tires but here\\'s the rub: service in the tire shop is terrible!  I\\'m certain it is part of their business model to under staff the tire shop so you have to wait for hours to get a tire rotation, leaving you with little alternative but to spend the time shopping in the warehouse.\\nAnd waiting in line to save a few cents on gasoline is just stupid.\\nI finally have had enough!\\nGoodbye Costco membership!\\nGood riddance!First of all I been a loyal Cora customer,  I been coming to them almost every other Sunday with my family \\n\\nWent here last Sunday. \\n\\nThe service overall was pretty bad.   Waitress was super rude and was rushing us to order.  Even though restaurant was not busy as I normally have seen them.   She had one other table beside ours.   We were so upset that we ask her not to serve us.  Completely ruin our time there. \\n\\nWe had ordered 3 dishes...  My dad\\'s was the last to get his and there was a 10 minute time difference from the time I got mine and him getting his. The portions have shrunk,  barely got any home fries. \\n\\nWe won\\'t be returning to this Coras again. And I will forward this to their head office.   They need to train their staff and do some quality control...  I hope this review turns off people from going here.After devouring an excellent meal next door in under 11 minutes, my friends and I still weren\\'t totally satisfied so we popped in this taco joint to check it out. We ordered a couple of tacos each and a couple of Mexican soft drinks to share. \\n\\nBeing born and partially raised in Mexico, I naturally asked for the salsas (in Spanish with a Chilango accent) when the lady brought our order. She nervously gave me an unbelievable response: \"we don\\'t prepare our food too spicy here.\" I couldn\\'t believe what I was hearing so I had to confirm:\" you don\\'t have salsa here?\" \"We don\\'t.\"\\n\\nI don\\'t know if they really don\\'t serve salsas or they ran out and had to use a lame excuse, but that and the fact that they put purple cabbage in their tacos, failed the test...go else where if you want Mexican tacos.I rated this a 1 star because the guy that served us was coughing which indicates the person is sick, or something else that he did. Anyways, I got sick with a flu-like symtomps after eating the food\\n\\nDisclaimer: There are other possibilities on why I am sick, but this is probably the reason why I got sickTo once be a king is delightful but to be a queen? Burgers don\\'t come with fries, nor any side of that matter. Kings demand a side to wash down such amounts of beef but this establishment foes not confide in those demands.In the 8 years I have owned my mountain bike, I have had to take it to at least 5 different shops because each one has closed or merged with another store. When I last went to go visit Adventure, I was literally mortified that they had closed but saw a sign on the door stating they had moved to Action.\\nHowever, upon my initial visit, I was not impressed. I came in to buy a spare tube and it literally took me a long time to find someone to help me.  Additionally, when I got to the repair counter to ask for a quote on a tuneup, the technician was on the phone and did not acknowledge me (Not even, \"I\\'ll be right with you).\\n\\nAfter this experience, I will not be back.I work in the office park where this place is located. I will eat there only out of desperation. In fact, this past Friday, I was short on time and skipped lunch rather than going there. Their food is mediocre at best. I think it changed hands in the Spring of 2008 and since then, portions are smaller, prices are higher, and I think the woman who appears to be the owner is irritating.   They charge you to pay with a debit/credit card. Also, their ventilation is not good, so you will leave there smelling like fried food.\\n\\nThe old owners were very nice people and very fair. My only complaint with them was that the coffee was Douwe Egberts and was terrible.This car rental company out of Mccarran Airport in Las Vegas NV is a RIP OFF!!!  They purposely leave out pertinent information when you book online!  I called the day of pick up to let them know to push back my pick up time & this is when I learned that I had to have an out of state license to utilize the reservation I had already made!  Apparently the reservation was for in town use!  Who does that? Who rents a care for in town use if you own a perfectly functioning vehicle?  Why would I make a reservation as such?  Now I am fighting for a refund as they charged me right on the spot for the reservation weeks back from my actual pick up date! The website is a sham as non of this was indicated on my confirmation page!!!  Dont rent your cars from this place people not unless you enjoy being scammed & RIPPED OFF!!! :-/Due to the horrible service from the \"Service Manager\" Meghan, I will never return to this location. My family and I have many great experience at this location including friendly service and great food. This time the food was not too great. My mom and dad ordered ribs that came out burnt and very dry. Of course they ate a couple ribs before making a complaint, which we hardly ever do. After I kindly asked the server to bring over her manager so we can address the issue to her, the service manager meghan came and agreed that the ribs were burnt and should have never made it out of the kitchen. She did not offer a replacement meal, instead took the meal and said she will take care of it. When we received our check, I noticed that a partial discount of $6.00 was taken off of the bill. I kindly requested the server to bring her manager back so we can address this problem again. Meghan comes back with an attitude and decided to argue with me about the food. She insisted that there was only a partial discount because my mom and dad ate a couple of ribs. I tell her that sure some of the food had been consumed but over half had to be thrown out and the total inconvenience should have been enough to take that meal off the tab. She decided to interrupt and give me a lecture on how the food should have not been consumed? I told her I don\\'t have a problem with the $6 discount so long as she would have offered a replacement meal! She was very unprofessional, very rude, with a nasty attitude. She failed her job as a \"service manager\" and ultimately made matters worse. Her horrible \"guest service\" was an experience that I never had before, and because of this I will refrain from coming to this location. I\\'m disappointed it had to come down to this because usually the service and food is great. \\nThanks a lot Meghan. \\n\\nSincerely a family who was looking for a nice meal to eat.My calamari was so so. My issue is with the professionalism of the staff.  When my change was brought to me the waitress said it is a dollar short because they ran out of change. She didn\\'t say \"when I get the change I will bring it to you\", or \"do you have a dollar and I will trade you a five?\" She took it upon herself to keep it. I was busy talking to friends so until I counted my change did we understand what she was telling us.  My friend said,\"did I just hear what I thought I heard\"?\\n\\nThe money is not the issue, it is the way it was handled and the attitude of matter of fact.\\n\\nThis had nothing to do with a tip since they already had added 20%. Truthfully I usually give 25%.Food\\'s good but the waiters are way too laid back and even impolite at times.\\n\\nOne waiter is looking insistently at my girlfriend. Not that I am jealous or that I lack confidence but they shall know when to behave like they are in a bar and when to behave like they are at work. I went twice there and the same waiter was intensively checking out female customers every time.\\n\\nThe other waiter wouldn\\'t take my order properly as he was standing very far from me when taking notes (like I was apparently supposed to shout at him to say what I wanted). He did dare arguing with me that I shall have said something as soon as I noticed that he wasn\\'t proposing me the proper sauces accompanying my meal...\\n\\nIt\\'s the french school of waiting, where being impolite is accepted. The difference is that, in France, tipping 15% of the bill is not the norm. I\\'m waiting for much more coming from a supposedly chic establishment (at last when one looks at the prices).\\n\\nMontreal does not lack of good restaurants with servers providing great service. I\\'m definitely not going back to Lemeac before a long time.I called Homeowners Financial Group to do a simple refinance and now that it\\'s finished I feel like I am in a worse position than when I started.  Initially the loan officer was very nice and worked with me on all options. After I agreed to go ahead is when I started feeling like I made a mistake. It seemed as if the loan officer was on her own and didn\\'t find things out till the last minute.  First it was the appraisal that needed to be done yesterday.  After the appraisal I was informed on a Friday that I needed to complete a very minor repair by Monday morning which resulted in me cancelling plans I had made out of town. The appraiser showed up and snapped one picture. A week later I get another $200 charge on my credit card from him which brought the total appraisal fee to $700. For as trivial as the repair was it makes me think that this might be a common practice to gouge the customer. Maybe the appraiser is related to someone at Homeowners? I don\\'t know?  \\n\\nWhen it came time to close there was no information on who was going to service my loan. I had a month before my payment was due and I was never contacted by phone or by mail. Finally I called them to ask if they would like my money and where should I send it, they did not know.  During this whole time I received letter after letter from multiple \"bi-weekly payment program\" companies they must have sold my information to. I gave it another couple days and called them back and asked again. They said a company called RCS would be servicing my loan and to send a check. First off it is 2015 and I don\\'t have any checks because I haven\\'t written one in 5 years. Second, even if I had a check it would not be there by the due date. I then tried calling the service number for RCS and it is 100%automated. Called Homeowners Financial again and they finally gave me a number to an actual person at RCS who told me I wouldn\\'t even be in the system until the due date and I would be charged a $5 fee for making that payment  Which again made me feel like my wallet has been ganged up on by these people. Absolute confusion followed up by fees. \\n\\n In hindsight It was not worth the hassle and I am missing the ease of my initial mortgage. Unexpected fees and  horrible loan servicing, I wouldn\\'t refer them to anybody.As of right now....1 star and that\\'s only because I had originally made an appointment for last Thursday (6/1) for 1p, and had to call just to find out that the appointment had been forgotten. Called today and left a VM. Hopefully this business can rectify the actions from last week and I will be more than happy to change my review. Here starts the waiting game. (Got a Groupon, too late to cancel and I don\\'t want the credits. This has to work out).\\n\\n\\n*Follow up (6/6): \\nRamsey just returned my call. Rescheduled for tomorrow Wed 6/7 for 11-1130a. Thank you sir!The employees were super rude and their wigs were not good at all they smelled like Barbie hair. This place needs to be shut down.i have been going here for almost 3 years.  Over the last year my dog has hesitated every time I start to go in.  Pulls away not wanting to go.  I noticed the haircuts were not as good.  Same person grooming all the time, very uncaring.  Last time was the final straw, cut his whiskers and eyelashes.  She actually shaved the hair by his eyes so close you could see his skin. .I can count how any times I have been with 1 hand. The last time we went will now be the last time we ever go. Anything that could have gone wrong, Did! I ended up having to get my kids there drinks from the bar 45 minutes after we ordered. Food was cold and soggy; could not tell the server cause we could not find her for 30 minutes.Deserve 0 stars. Need new remote and asked about that. Was told remote was $35-$45 and programming would be $25. Took me asking 3 times to even get that info. Was told tech could tell me when arrived but I wanted to know before hand. Made an appt for between 11am-2pm for remotes and programming. 2 o\\'clock rolls around and nobody shows. I called at 2:03 inquire about lateness. Tech was on his way, approx 15 mins out. I asked about a free remote or programming since late. Was told no they don\\'t do work for free. I asked why they set appts they aren\\'t keeping then. And asked to cancel then. Tech sounded angry and asked so you don\\'t want us to come out because we won\\'t work for free? I started to say no but a discount should be offered because you can\\'t keep your appts and was hung up. \\nCalled back to speak with a manager. Was busy so gave my name and number. We\\'ll see if they bother calling back.Complete misrepresentation. Originally quoted one price and it went up by almost double upon delivery.  Dishonest and unprofessional. Should have trusted the negative reviews, but when I questioned it, was told that the company was under new ownership. \\nWill definitely be doing more research if I am ever in need of moving services again.This place was absolutely awful. In August I paid them a deposit of $370. to recover 3 bar stools in black leather, with another $360. due when the job was done. After hearing nothing after 6 weeks I called a was told next week. This went on every week for another six weeks. I finally went in person and the guy said give me 2 days- supposedly they only just found where they put the chair.  Five days later I went in person again and once again nothing was done. I took my bar stool back and asked that they refund my Visa the $370. They claimed the guy who could do it wasn\\'t in until Wednesday although there was only ever the one guy dealing with all transactions and he was the same guy who processed my Visa payment so total lie. Now I have to try to dispute these charges through my Visa. Totally don\\'t recommend this place and whatever you do don\\'t pay until the service is provided or you will be ripped\\n\\nUpdate some weeks later after some back and forth I did finally get my deposit refunded, so not a complete disasterSecond time visiting this place last night and I guess the old saying is true... \"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, can\\'t blame Hot Taco\"\\n\\nServers that have no idea about the food on the menu, long waits for the mediocre food, gross house cocktails. The kitchen seemed overwhelmed and confused as we watched and waited for our food to come out lukewarm and flavorless, there is a guy with dreadlocks and ho hat cooking in an open kitchen (health department violation). This place has to be one of the worst concept ideas in restaurant history and now that there is a petition to have them remove the statues in front of the entrance I think it will be interesting to see how long until it is closed and revamped.\\n\\nDefinitely a huge miss for the Bottle Cap Group on this one, but I guess that sometimes some ideas look way better on paper.Got brow extensions here- and they were so awful, the customer service I received afterwards was even worse. I had to take them all off once I got home, she never cleaned off my eyebrows to begin with and glued the hairs directly on my eyebrows, not my skin. They were going in all different directions and falling off. They looked extremely fake which is not what the pictures looked like. I couldn\\'t brush my eyebrows or even try to fill them in a little to hide how they looked because they were literally HARD. You could see the glue everywhere. It felt like I just took a bunch of plastic eyebrow hairs and soaked them in elmers glue and pressed them randomly onto my eyebrows. I texted the lady who did them afterwards, she was very nice while doing them, but she wouldn\\'t give me a refund or even a partial refund and I had to take them all off, which ripped out some of my real eyebrow hairs! Big waste of money.Let me start off saying that we want ALL Phoenix restaurants to thrive.\\n\\nWe popped in on Sunday late morning 3.1.15 all knowing that Gallo Blanco was no longer and wanted to have a nice experience at a former fave spot of ours. We were disappointed. I try not to write negative reviews but we left the restaurant upset and feeling was we just wasted our time and money....The food and service was terrible. \\n\\n-The bar was dirty and unkempt, terrible first impression.\\n-Staff stood at the bar while one pregnant server chatted about her personally aches and pains as we ate. Gross \\n-That same staff proceeded to order her lunch in front of us for 10minutes, go to another register! \\n-The menu is way overpriced \\n-The tacos lacked flavor ie tasted like white grandma tacos from Minnesota where she found the recipe from a 1979 issue of sunset mag\\n- The presentation of the tacos- terrible. Just slapped down open face on a plate by that same grandma or from a prison kitchen \\n- $8 mimosa on a Sunday, really?!\\n- No brunch specials or items of any kind \\n- $5 small iced toddy- that price is ridiculous \\n- Music was barley playing and what was heard was not impressive \\n-We just left and walked by a group of staff and no, thank you, see you later etc. \\n\\nUnderstanding the concept had to transition quickly but there should be no excuse for bad service and dirtiness. I don\\'t see how anyone would can\\'t to come here until they dramatically change things and get their act together. \\n\\n- peace, love n tacos \\nmThey greet you when you enter the store but then they are done with you. We were looking for shoes for an adult woman, an adult man and an 8 year old girl so basically we were all over the store.  The entire time my granddaughter was trying on 8 different pairs of shoes two employees stood nearby having a conversation but never offering assistance. In fact a customer walked up to them and waited for them to stop talking and turn to him which they never did and he left in disgust.  I gave up looking for shoes for myself because I was too annoyed with the store  .  When I paid for my Granddaughters shoes the cashier asked if I wanted some kind of loyalty card and I said no I would not because I did not plan on ever returning and told him about the lack of assistance.  He didn\\'t care.   They had shoes I was interested in but never found.  For the price of their shoes you would expect a little assistance.Mr. Hammond was the seller\\'s agent and I was the buyer.  At the very least, one would think the seller\\'s agent would do whatever it took to make the selling process go smoothly in the interest of closing the transaction.  However, it seemed Mr. Hammond decided he would throw as many \"roadblocks\" in the way as possible, from negotiation to inspections to repairs to closing to even providing all of the keys for the property.   While legally his role is to represent the seller, he provided no assistance to the buyer or the buyer\\'s agent -- seemingly just to prove he didn\\'t have to.  I wonder if Mr. Hammond realizes what kind of impression his \"do nothing, care less\" attitude leaves on prospective future customers -- ESPECIALLY since he\\'s a \"highly touted, award winning realtor\" with the sixth largest online realty company:  ZIP REALTY.Worst customer service and horrible quality I\\'ve never had my nails look so bad and that\\'s besides the fact that he nipped my skin about 6 times hurt so badly and would just keep going NEVER WILL I RETURNI went to the Morpheus Clinic a while back and after a short conversation, was told that I was not hypnotizable.  \\n\\nHypnotizability is seen as an ability, and not having it appears to be a handicap.\\n\\nHypnotists who think like this are behind the times, and need to go back to hypnotism school.Agent gave me a \"free\" upgrade but charged me later. Unable to resolve with cc company and no live agent. Will NOT be using Budget ever again.Look at the unit you will be moving into not the model prior to signing anything. Broke my lease early only after acouple months due to an ongoing roach problem. Management insisted multiple foggings would resolve the issue but they kept coming back. Instead of moving out I tried to see about Management moving me to another unit but they would not work with me whatsoever. At one point, I came home after a fogging and maintenance had moved literally everything around (i\\'m talking the big appliances) without bothering to put anything back. Sure I get everything has to be moved and theres a waiting period but I found it extremely disrespectful that no one thought about returning after the waiting period to out back the heavy items. The appliances had been lifted a pretty significant distance from the wall and dealing with lower back issues moving it back alone was rough. I eventually got tired of waking up with at least one roach crawling across my face every night - I kid you not. It even got to the point where roaches didn\\'t even bother hiding during the day. They would come out of the ac vents, the sink, the closet, and any dark space out of reach. The roaches have quite the life though. They get to live there for FREE. \\n\\nDocumented everything which also included my intent to break my lease due to the inability to remediate a serious health issue. Manager tried telling me that I was not going to get out of the lease break amount. Of course they sent me to collections, not sure if my documentation sent to the collections agency or the Property managements company\\'s lack of response helped me win my dispute but I managed to get the collection removed. Oh and don\\'t negotiate whatsoever with the colonnade. I felt like the collections reps were more helpful than the staff that work up in corporate. Crazy right?\\n\\nCheck out the pics. Not only was I dealing with roaches when all the drawers got pulled back there was crap left by the other tenant that the cleaning team missed.Only way we could post is give it one star, nothing better than 4 kids playing grab ass. Some of the veggies were empty, said to wait they were getting more.Place was filthy, no clean up anywhere. Place is new with no management. We have pizza at other papa Murphy\\'s stores,always been good. Will not go back and I live here! Go to the Craig st location, run excellent and the pizza was right on. Good luckSlow service and more expensive then the usual sushi spot.  Lots of people waiting on their dinner and no waitress in sight!   More expensive to eat in then take out.Check order if you do takeout.  Missing some of our food and didn\\'t want to drive all the way back to get it.Do not stay at this hotel. Management is stealing money. Mexican manager Juan inflates prices per week. The staff is incompetent. You can never get a straight answer regarding billing. I questioned why weekly payment did not go down once all \"fees\" and \"deposits\" were paid. Mexican manager Juan told me to pack my things and leave. I was fully prepared to pay fee that was quoted to me by staff member Brenda. Mexican manager Juan informed me she did not quote me the correct amount. He stated she failed to add in a pet fee and charge from previous week. When Mexican manager Juan gave me a total it was the total I paid the week before. When I pointed this out to him he became angry and enrage and yelled that he would not do business with me. They owe me a deposit. This company will say you will get a refund on your $100 deposit but you have to stay 30 days or more. I was due my refund this week. I tried to call corporate but only get a voicemail when I call the number. Person on message sounds just like Mexican manager Juan. I contacted the Better Business Bureau since I cannot get a return call from Siegal Suites Corporate office. I have kept all documents regarding my stay at this hell hole. Please beware of this facility. There are roaches, open drug trades, prostitution and children unattended running everywhere. Complained about the marijuana smells coming thru apartment and was laughed at by Brenda. I only gave this review a one star b/c you have to give a star in order to leave a review. This establishment needs to be shut down. All criminal activity needs to be investigated. This establishment preys on the desperate. Thank GOD I have other means.No stars would be a more accurate rating. My feet feel like sand paper after a pedicure. Their recommendation: go home and put some vaseline. More nail polish on my toes than on my nails. Never going back.We stayed there this weekend and upgraded to a suite that costed over $2000.00 for the stay. There were bugs in the room, it took 3 calls for in room dining to clean up. We had an issue with management Shari and Manuel the front desk managers. Very RUDE!! We will never stay there again. By far the Bellagio and Caesars are 100% better than this Venetian.If you are thinking about bringing your compound pharmacy needs here - DON\\'T! Twice now they have had issues filling my prescription in a timely manner causing me to be days without my medication. THEY TAKE 5 -10 BUSINESS DAYS to fill a prescription...when things go right. This month I called in my refill 8 days prior to needing it. I prepaid for the medication and, because this location was closed from water damage, they offered one time free delivery. They said it would be delivered on the 22nd (a week away). There was no delivery on the 22nd so I called on the 23rd. They told me they had made a clerical error and my prescription had never been filled. So I\\'m thinking they are going to put someone right on it and get it done - NOPE. The earliest they could get it done was in 7 days. I told them I would run out of medication in 2 days - still the earliest they could do was 7 days. I told them this was the second month in a row they haven\\'t been able to fill in a timely manner. They said again, 7 days. If I needed it sooner, I would have to call around to find a compound pharmacy that could get it done sooner. Both times, they did nothing to help me and even when it was their mistake- it was my problem. Horrible customer service.Walked in, walked out. $7 bologna sandwich with no sides is their advertised $6 lunch. (All others $8+ and No one else was in there for lunch at 12- all I need to know. )Everything was great but how does a brand new place run out of food when it just recently opened and it is trying to get loyal customers. Half of the things they promote is their food and for them to not be serving it, and without any sign of notice until I got to the register is extremely disappointing. \\n\\nThe staff seemed extremely all over the place and the person yelling out order numbers was being overly aggressive when calling them out.No stars for this business..Dropped off a dress for alteration on a Saturday with a promise to complete on Thursday. Showed up to pick up dress on Friday morning and not done. No apology and not even an excuse. If I didn\\'t have a party in Friday I would have taken unaltered dress and left. Done last minute with a lot of stress. Will not return to this business. Not reliable.The best thing about this place is the building and neighborhood in which it sits.\\n\\nThe doctors are limited in time and knowledge. They always have seemed as they were guessing on a diagnosis or just perscribing a useless test to protect themselves. Not to mention an average office visit is $175. The staff often seemed clueless and rude. Not sure how or if there is any regulatory organization monitoring this tragedy.\\n\\nIt is shocking how this company gets away with such a poor service in this neighborhood.The ice cream is good, but the service is poor. The guy at counter not only took his time greeting us when we walked in,  but also took his time getting our order, and making it. The co-worker that was there with him went to hide in the backroom while he struggled to get the first cup of ice cream made. Finally she came out of hiding and helped him. Still slow, but no longer at a snails pace. Gave the 1 star rating bcuz of the service and lack of cleanliness.  The tables look like they haven\\'t been touched with hot water in days.Came here for a morning/lunch buffet and it sucked bad! My friends and I were hungover, not to mention starving, and were too lazy to walk over to Paris for their buffet so we decided to just try it here since we stayed in Bally\\'s anyways.\\n\\nI didnt enjoy the food one bit. The good thing about this place is that it has quite a lot of seating so there wasn\\'t any waiting when we arrived, but I dont think i\\'ll ever be back.Worst walmart in Phoenix. I hate that this is the most convenient location for me. Every time I go I leave exhausted, shocked, or irritated. The bathrooms are always a riot-no supplies, gross, etc. I was using the sink while someone was essentially karate chopping and punching the paper towel dispenser. People shopping have approached me or harassed me inside and outside the store. Last time I went it looked like the zombie apocalypse had happened because the parking lot bomb had gone off with carts and trash littered everywhere. There were more carts in parking spots than cars. Also, this particular walmart only has the bare minimum of barely human cashiers open. I\\'ve waited 20+ minutes for a quick stop late at night. I think there\\'s just so many people rolling through this store acting like barbaric rabid filthy animals that the store cannot keep up. Avoid at all costs.Entire order was wrong....no special instructions were read or followed! They offered to remake if i bring them back what i didn\\'t like.  It\\'s not that i didn\\'t like it - u made it wrong and i paid for delivery so now i have to go there after 2 days of traveling??  Won\\'t order again!Ugh can\\'t get the wet dog smell out of my head. Really?  Have to nuke a piece of nearly paper thin chicken to reheat?\\n\\nAnd thinking about it the miso was watery as was the thin, strangely colored teriyaki sauce!   $32 lunch ... What a waste!Told is it would be an hour wait, it took 2. They blamed it in how busy they were (which is understandable) However the center council was dirtier than when we dropped it off and we spent $50. We will not be back.I called at about 5:20 to see if they could get me in for a full set. A man picked up the phone. I inquired about my services and he and his minions busted out laughing in the background as if they were laughing at me asking about a full set. I told him I could be there in 10 minutes, he says\" Uh, how bout twenty?!?\" as he and his minions were still cackling in the background...how unprofessional and rude.\\n\\nYou\\'re not the only nail shop open until 7 in the area!\\n\\nI didn\\'t even bother going...they let me know they weren\\'t about shit right over the phone. I ended up going to Hollygood Nails. My full set was complete within 40 minutes and they were extremely professional and clean.Spent over $30 trying to order a new 52 comic book with a hard cover from this store. I attempted to cancel this order via phone today during business hours with nobody answering at all, three weeks after placing this order with nothing to show for it. When I arrived to the store in person to cancel the request, they claimed it could not be done; their reasoning was nobody would ever buy the hard cover of this book, at a COMIC BOOK store. This comment was than followed up with the idea of getting a fraction of the money back as store credit...\\n\\nGot the same hardcover book for 12 dollars on Amazon in two days.\\n\\nMy bank agreed, I had every right to not process the transaction due to lack of service, and it was canceled on my behalf and determined to be fraud.We are locals that had started enjoying Toast (and bragging about it to other locals) on a fairly regular basis.  We had enjoyed great meals just about every time we visited.  However, like other posters, it was confusing to have three or four people coming by the table.  Also, one reviewer referred to the female manager as \\'a bitch\\'.  That\\'s a bit stronger word than I would have used, but I knew immediately who she was talking about.  During our last visit many months ago, my wife\\'s hamburger that was ordered medium rare was delivered with a cold, bleeding center.  No big deal, we flagged down one of the multiple people that had visited our table and asked them to cook it a bit more.  We were very reluctant to do this because it had boursin cheese on top and we just didn\\'t know how it would come back.  It came back medium well with no pink in the center.  The aforementioned female manager came by to see how things were and we expressed our disappointment.  She explained to us that the cook had recently moved here from New York and \\'...he was still learning how to cook for people in North Carolina.\\'  Huh?  After this comment sank in for a few minutes, it got me a bit ticked off.  My wife and I have both eaten in New York plenty and they cook meat the same way we have requested it all over the country, including North Carolina.  The manager also told us that she checked the burger when it was first sent back and that it was cooked the way it was ordered.  Well, admittedly, we asked for medium rare and that isn\\'t a long way from rare, but we got extra rare.  Anyone would have sent that burger back, I think.\\n\\nSo, according to this \\'manager\\', either the cook prepared the burger correctly and we were wrong, or we were idiots from North Carolina that didn\\'t know how to order our food, as far as we could tell.  Since that visit, we have never returned and we will not go back as long as that woman is there.  We have stopped bragging about the place and now, instead, relate our last experience.  Others have shared similar opinions with us.  Recently, at Christmas in Davidson, we were cruising the food vendor tents and saw her manning the Toast tent.  Too bad, we would have loved to pick up something there, but there was no way I was going to give that woman any of my money.\\n\\nGreg S.Now there is a problem plaster cracking and cool deck breaking up after just 2 years  now desert springs don\\'t want to answer emailsWe have been in Verona for about a year now.  We have brought our children here and liked the food.  Recently we are remodeling our kitchen and eat here about once a week.  We happen to like sitting near the bar area for our kids to watch the fish and we can watch the Brewer game. We do not sit at the bar and our children are fairly well mannered. Tonight we were asked to leave the bar area and our children would be best seated somewhere else. Very disappointed in our service this evening.Went to this spot to order some takeout.  Ordered an Enchilada and Taco combo, both beef, along with other items for the family.  The taco, which normally has a crispy shell, was thrown into the enchilada sauce.  The person bringing us our order did not check to ensure order accuracy.  I was upset about the taco being soggy and gross, and went on to the enchilada, and it was chicken instead of beef.  Two strikes in one menu item.  The family got chimichangas, which were alright but were also sitting in a thick puddle of water.  \\n\\nTheir to go boxes are those that you would recieve an elementary school lunch in- styrofoam with segments.  The beans were thrown into one segment and the rice into another, allowing for cross contamination.  I\\'m pretty sure the beans should be in a separate container, at the very least.\\n\\nBottom line, don\\'t order takeout from here.  They don\\'t take the time to ensure order accuracy, and they are not equipped with the proper boxes to handle takeout to begin with.This nursery school used to have a good reputation but things have gone downhill under new management.   They are at 186 Morrison after having to find a new location.   I have found some staff to be abrasive and loud with the children.   Very little educational base.... My child learned more at home than here.  For the brief time she attended, there was a terrorist threat which was so scary (it\\'s in a religious building) and an exceeding amount of dangerous stairs difficult for smaller kids to maneuver.  Wouldn\\'t recommend this option with so many other quality choices nearby.Not cosmic, mediocre. How old is that bread? They don\\'t seem to be trying very hard. Shredded mozzarella on an Italian sub?My car was due to be ready at 2. It is now almost 6. I kindly asked ONE time for an eta and was YELLED AT AND CURSED AT in front of a crowded lobby for all to hear. Then the mgr justified it by saying that the detail tech has been under a lot of stress and walked away. SHOCKING. Danny\\'s has lost another loyal customer. \\nAnthony has a MAJOR anger mgmt problem. And his mgr Jordan appears to be totally fine with his his employee treating women (or anyone) that way.  These people are scary thugs.Came here to get my son\\'s haircut, walked in an stood there for 10 mins before I was even greeted. Then someone finally walks up, well actually they were walking out of the salon and asks are you here for a haircut? I said yes for my son and then they say something in Spanish to another stylist  and then says to me they have no one avail to cut hair. Never suggests a time to come back or asks if I\\'d like to schedule an appt for later or anything and then just walks out. First impression of this place was a bad impression and I won\\'t be back..I will not stay here ever again!!! Aside from how much you spend on the rooms, when you book and confirm the total they give you will not be the total you have to pay upon checkout! Don\\'t even think about using the fridge in your room as its full of mini bar items that if you even touch you will be charged for. They still tried to charge me for items that I wasn\\'t even close to touching! The room had the most terrible view, the cleaning service was atrocious and on top of that they still over charged me for my room after I kept repeatedly calling to have them fix my bill! For all you pay for a suite here you could save your money and stay anywhere else and actually have a pleasant stay! Usually I stay at the Paris but wanted something special for my boyfriend\\'s birthday...I will never abandon Paris again!WORST SERVICE IN TEMPE!!!!! Like the WORST....\\n\\nHighly understaffed and rude to boot.\\n\\nFirst off all you\\'d have to be drunk to enjoy the awful food and since we are having trouble even ordering a drink it\\'s just a miserable experience. \\n\\nI won\\'t ever be returning to El Hefe for any reason. Even if they were giving away Tequila for free, I\\'d find another spot to drink. \\n\\nClearly they make lots of money and the management doesn\\'t care for their customers. \\n\\nIn a town full of bars there\\'s lots of other good choices to drink and spend your $$$\\n\\nDon\\'t go to El Hefe!!!If I could give this 0 stars I would.\\nDelivery took an hour. Pizza arrived cold and not prepared as ordered. Sausage is completely unseasoned pork topping.  Gross is the only word I can think of to describe this pizza. Save your money. You\\'ll get better pizza from the frozen food aisle at Giant Eagle.They get no stars from me but it won\\'t let me post without at least one. Twice in one year they raised my rent. I moved my stuff out 10 days prior to the next month but they still billed me because their office staff is rude and  incompetent. When I went to ask for a refund the lady gave me even more attitude. She set it up to refund the wrong amount and when I tried to correct her she rolled her eyes wrote it on the paper and said \"it\\'ll get fixed.\" I still got refunded the wrong amount and when I called about it she got even more of an attitude and said \"Well if you want to come get this little bit of money then you can come here and I\\'ll give it to you cash.\" I have never been more disrespected by a group of office employees as a whole in my entire life. Do not go here if you do add $50 to what they originally tell you and don\\'t expect to ever get good customer service.I don\\'t know why I keep giving this place another try... Service is terribly slow. From ordering drinks to getting the check, wait time was too ridiculous. Workers were not attentive. They see us waiting and looking bored but never cared to stop by. They never came by to refill the coals. It\\'s really not that hard to observe your customers once in a while. \\n\\nAlso, the free appetizer coupon for first check-in was bogus. During my first time here, the waitress said they do not accept the coupons via phone apps anymore, and I would have to print it out and give it to them. C\\'mon, how is anyone supposed to know to print the coupon if it\\'s their first time checking-in? \\n\\nSpend your time and money on something else folks.DO NOT EAT HERE! Overpriced food that tastes horrible and a staff with a bad attitude. There are plenty of other great buffets on the strip! Do yourself a favor avoid this place.The pizza is just ok and it\\'s definitely not fast like they claim to be. Currently waiting on my pizza for 30 minutes, and counting...This place blew junks tonight. Take out order wasn\\'t ready because \"we ran out of chicken \",  missed completely two ordered items which we didn\\'t know until home. Don\\'t go there. Not going back.\\n\\nUpon review of other commenters on Yelp, my experience last night at Pita Jungle was not unique. Not going back.My husband and I made a reservation here on 2/10/11 for his birthday. Our reservation was for 6:45pm. When we arrived the restaurant  was maybe 40% full. We were seated at a small 2 person table, RIGHT next to another couple. There was maybe 4 inches of space between the tables. The hostess had to pull the table out so a person could sit on the bench side!!! The couple next to use was less than thrilled at 1) we were seated so close in a nearly empty restaurant  and 2) that thier food had taken way to long to come out. We got up and left. Totally unimpressed, will not try this place again, and will not encourage anyone else to eat there.Paid $70 to fix a cracked screen on an iPhone and problem was not fixed! Phone screen never worked properly again. I took it back a month later and he told me it was too late since it was after 30 day guarantee. My only option was to pay him \"to fix\" it again. Place is a rip-off, don\\'t go here!What the hell happened?  Went here again, exact same time of year, one of the same servers.... the place was dead and I see why!  The bar didn\\'t have a bartender in the middle of the day, the service was horrible, the food was crap, even the girl at the cash register was rude.  Wow, what a decline.  Last year was so great, the place was rammed and times were good.  The worst turnaround I have ever seen.  How do you mess up a Denny\\'s?  Wow.New to Las Vegas and having a difficult time finding a good barber.\\nThere were two things I asked John not to do. \\nDo not cut my hair short in the front and do not follow the shape of the top of my head.\\nI asked for a four and he cut it all one size that was much smaller than a four.\\nOn top of that he left a bunch of longer hairs sticking up.\\nThe sides were good, but that does\\'t do any good when the rest is wrong.\\nI let him know I was unhappy.\\nHe did not apologize or offer any type of resolve.\\nThis was my first and last time there.Perhaps the best way to describe this place is consistent... consistently BAD. I have been in the somewhat unique, albeit unenviable, position to have sampled a large variety of their lunch items. From their fish tacos to burgers to various chicken and deli sandwiches, corn chowder, and smoothies, I have yet to discover something that is at least half-decent.\\n\\nPerhaps, more specifics are in order. The fried fish had a cold, thick, and dried-out texture of cardboard. The greasy burgers were overcooked and had a soggy bun. The chicken is dry, lacking in flavor, and smothered with oily cheese. The corn chowder is a nasty gelatinous goo. The smoothies are extremely sweet and not as thick as they ought to be. You get the idea...  \\n\\nWhy would I continue to subject myself to such awful food? One of the facilities, where I work, will order lunch for us from various places if we are working through the lunch hour. I\\'m not completely sure who is responsible for picking the place each time, but there must be some kind of kickbacks taking place because I cannot fathom why they seem to keep picking this place over a vastly superior alternative like Tropical Smoothie Cafe.\\n\\nOne time, when they asked me what I wanted to order, I told them that I would pass. However, this woman felt really bad and insisted on suggesting something that I would like. I ended up ordering some sort of chicken sandwich which was, surprise surprise, terrible. The most recent time they ordered from here, to avoid hurting anyone\\'s feelings, I just ordered some random sandwich. I took it with me when I left the facility but dumped it in the nearest trash bin. I felt bad wasting \"food\" and for a moment thought that maybe I should give it to some homeless person. Then again, if I had, they might think that I was trying to poison them.Wow. And this is not a good wow at all.\\n\\nDid NOT expect such bad food here. My fellow diners said they had better steaks from Outback, possibly Sizzler and Cocos.\\n\\nThe waiters seem programmed to try to upsell everything. The only \"amazing\" food on the menu from the kitchen are the highest priced items. \\n\\nConsidering how much amazing food is available in Vegas, Beso sucks some major donkey balls. The various managers are completely useless.  The manager we got to \"work\" with Chad Jahn is beyond useless. The consensus is that he\\'s an ex-bouncer and doesn\\'t even know how to manage to make a drink much less manage a high-profile restaurant.\\n\\nThere seems to be too many staff running around pretending to be busy than actually working.  I saw no less than 3 managers pretty much walking the floor doing nothing.  None of them went up to any tables to inquire about the food, the service or anything that would normally be relevant to their jobs. There were too many hostesses worried about their outfits and make-up and being seen. \\n\\nNow, onto the food. Again, WOW. It was beyond awful--once it actually came out.  Apparently our ticket got dropped TWICE by the kitchen. And, did any manager come out to apologize and try to make nice? Uh, that\\'d be a no.\\n\\nThat\\'s where the wonderful and awfully helpful /insert sarcasm here Chad came over. And he only came over because we actually asked the waiter where the manager was and why he wasn\\'t the one trying to sooth things over with us.  Instead, we told him what we expected from our service. Comped food, a steep discount and free dessert/coffee/tea. At least he had the competency to do that, so I guess there is some hope. BUT, the best part is--he wasn\\'t the one telling us. Our poor waiter was the one breaking the news. Isn\\'t that a manager\\'s job?\\n\\nThe waiter and his trainee were so sweet and trying to help out, but honestly, what else can they do? I think they pretty much gave up when they knew how much of the dinner was going to be cut, therefore reflecting their tip. We made sure they were compensated for their work. As for the main tab? Aw hale naw.  Took whatever discount they gave us. Normally our group would order 1-2 desserts to share. Yeah, call us greedy and bitter, but we each ordered one.  The sad thing is? Even the dessert took 15 minutes to come out AND it wasn\\'t good.\\n\\nThe one star was because our waiter actually tried so hard.\\n\\nFinal report: More style than substance.By far the worst service I\\'ve ever encountered in my life. Not only did we ask for rice 3 times... it never came. Water wasn\\'t filled once. Two ladies working and four tables seated. This place can sucks. I don\\'t understand how you forget when someone\\'s asks 3 times for a spacific item. Water? Cmon that\\'s automatic. I don\\'t care what excuse you have, that should never be forgotten. Last time I eat here. I don\\'t recommend anyone eating here. We had to ask for our check 2 times and only when the next shift came we got our check. Go to honey pig. That place is better. Better food and service at honey pig.This review is for New Years Eve. We came for dinner, we had no problem getting in at 7:30 (we didn\\'t have a reservation) and we literally made plans that evening for our night (that\\'s another story). \\n\\nWe see the sign advertising $29 all you can drink at the bar starting after 9:30pm. We decided to give it a shot. \\n\\nWell, we pay for our wristband and proceed to the bar area. We see two bartenders working. I get the feeling this isn\\'t a good idea, and it\\'s too late now since we bought our wristband.  \\n\\nI wait for nearly 20 minutes for a drink, I ask for two since I know it\\'s going to take forever to get another drink. He wouldn\\'t give me two. My friend comes back with two drinks in her hand. Now I\\'m irritated on top of annoyed. By 10 pm the place is PACKED. It 3-4 deep at the bar and still only 2 bartenders. \\n\\nNow I\\'m no bar manager, but something tells me that if you advertise $29 all you can drink on NYE, you might want to have more than two bartenders on hand. \\n\\nI ended up getting two drinks the entire night. On my way out, I almost slipped in vomit and spilled drinks on the floor. Classy. \\n\\nWill I go back? Probably not.Polar Air has provided me with probably the WORST A/C service I\\'ve ever had.  I\\'ve had the tech out to look at my A/C unit several times.  The first service call was because the air wasn\\'t blowing at all, and that only some vents seemed to have airflow through them.  The tech told me that he needed to order a new part.  Fast forward 2 weeks and between their customer service department telling me they ordered the wrong part, and the tech telling me that the part was installed already (after the service department admitted that they don\\'t actually have the correct part yet) and this has just been a fiasco.  I\\'ve resorted to taping strips of tissue to my vents to show the tech the lack of airflow.  Still, after all of this, my A/C is lukewarm.  I not only recommend against Polar Air in the Las Vegas area, but I will tell any and everyone who asks to literally go to any one else.  Joey the HVAC tech is especially one to avoid.Disaster .. Wishing I could give 3 negative stars . Had asked for a bid for 2 panes that had the plastic panes slipping . First bid was high and I had SR Windows and Glass give me another .. What was missing in their end bid was a job half done .Now I only have one window with drooping pane..Just nuts !\\n If you are crazy enough to deal with these people get everything in detail and in writing as they are super \\'smoke and mirrors show\\' with this aspect.\\nWhen I told them that \"both windows had the bronze \\'panes\\'\" and mentioning I wanted \"them\" fixed I received a bid ,but seemingly only for one pane ..Now it looks horrible as only one was fixed and paid more than 60% of the previous bid ,what a rip . Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder could have ascertained what was needed and what I wanted but now it looks junk . My advice is shop around and if you feel the need to support this business get  detailed estimate on exactly what is happening . Better yet choose another company with better dealings and customer service . I give SR Windows & Glass = huge FAIL .So sad, we saw this on triple D\\'s and went out of our way to come and they were closed for the 4th of July week. I would have called if this was the 4th but this was the 6th of July and I was shocked that the entire place was closed. Definitely, call before going to make sure they are open.**Maybe a 2 star, only because it\\'s the ONLY taco place around.\\n\\nI\\'ve lived about  a 5-minute walk from here pretty much all my life, and I love tacos! My excitement sky-rocketed when I noticed this little place opened up so close to home and finally came to check it out a couple weeks ago.  The owner of Le Canard Mort closed down the former Le Resignol and opened this new little taco bar.  I have never been to the other restaurants, but Le Canard Mort has definitely been on my radar, and I cross my finger it will be much better than this.\\n\\nThere were two of us when we came and thought it was closed because it was so dark and empty.  It could have just been because it was late afternoon during down time, but I\\'ve never seen more than 2 people in here at a time anyway.\\n\\nWe were casually greeted, and we picked up a menu off the table.  It consists of enchiladas ($13-$16), burritos ($9-$12), nachos, and a few salads.  The tacos range from $4.50 to $9 each, or you can choose to get the platter of 2 which includes rice and salad.  And so for a quick lunch:\\n\\nBlackened Catfish Taco Platter: $14 (2/5 stars)\\nThe fish itself was cooked and seasoned well.  However, it was not hot... warm at best.  The yellow mole lacked flavour, and the mango salsa was... meh (I can make way better!).  Overall, a bit dry and lacking in flavour... and heat.  Very disappointed with the \"platter\" aspect since it was a tiny scoop of bland rice with what seemed like canned black beans heated in a microwave and poured on top.  The salad was several lettuce leaves with... I forgot what else (not worth the mention anyway).\\n\\nShrimp Taco Platter: $14 (1.5/stars)\\nShrimp was cooked well, but definitely lacked flavour, chipotle mole was inexistent according to my taste buds.  The tomatillo salsa was alright, but missing the bold taste tomatillo salsas promise to deliver.  Again, a bit dry and I wished I hadn\\'t gotten the platter... double disappointment.\\n\\nService: (2/5 stars)\\n2.5 stars.  The server was nice, but there was really nothing that was done to put her above the McDonald\\'s counter service.  We originally asked to get the food to go, but decided to stay after we got the food.  She brought some utensils, napkins, and bottled sauces, then she reached into our bag and took the packaged sauces back so we wouldn\\'t waste it.  I mean, I hate to waste and would have probably given it back anyway... but SERIOUSLY?!\\n\\nI am a forgiving person and I believe (almost) everyone deserves a second chance.  Chef\\'s and restaurants have their bad days too, so yes, I will go back ONE DAY to get ONE taco and hope that it will make up for EVERYTHING.  The concept is what I really admire, but the food, cooks, service, and atmosphere need to step it up BIG TIME!The atm machine never lets you deposit cash. This is 3 days In a row it blows my mind how it never works hereSaigon Kitchen is not representative of Vietnamese food. I have tried it three times and have yet to have any dish that is authentic Vietnamese. For Vietnamese food, I\\'ll stick with Pho Viet Nam or Saigon Pho in Chandler --- where more realistic Vietnamese food can be found. \\n\\nAnyone who calls this great Vietnamese food simply has never tasted real Vietnamese food. And any vet who says this is just like the food in Nam was, I can assure you, either high or eating at the base. \\n\\nCalling Saigon Kitchen Vietnamese food is as bad as those that call Olive Garden Italian food or Red Lobster seafood.I would strongly suggest you double check anything Paradise OB-GYN tells you regarding insurance approvals and requirements. I went through 3 invasive pre-requisites they told me needed to be done in order for BCBS to cover a procedure. One of which was a painful biopsy. I had already had 2 of the 3 alleged pre-requisites done 14 months prior and Dr. Newman admitted to me in the office he wouldn\\'t have had me re-do my imaging if his staff would have asked him, but his name is on the order for the imaging. His staff told me my imaging from 2017 had expired and updated imaging was required by BCBS. This has thus far turned out to be false. As far as the biopsy, Dr. Newman told me he didn\\'t understand why it was a requirement of insurance companies and he wouldn\\'t do it on someone my age if it wasn\\'t required by BCBS, yet he performed the biopsy and billed my insurance company. Again, his staff told me it was required in order to have my procedure. This also has thus far turned out to be false. I found out they NEVER even called BCBS to verify they were necessary to have my procedure covered!!! Apparently, they got some claim denials on other claims and are having women go through invasive pre-requisites that apparently Dr. Newman himself does not require/recommend and a majority of insurance companies and plans do not require! The office staff blamed corporate. Corporate tried to blame the office staff. Traci, the director of revenue cycle in corporate, told me they don\\'t call your insurance company to verify what is required. She e-mailed me The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology guidelines and told me it details what is \"appropriate\". The ACOG guidelines are not the same as an insurance carriers requirements and to me \"appropriate\" just means what they can get away with billing to your insurance carrier. I\\'m incredibly frustrated I didn\\'t verify the information myself and I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s border line insurance fraud to perform not one, not two, but three unnecessary tests, and possibly an unnecessary office visit. I\\'m fairly confident a new patient office visit from 2017 is valid for 3 years and you can bill an established patient office visit with an in-office procedure on the same day. The office visit would most likely be denied inclusive to the procedure so I get why they would want me to come in again before my procedure. To get paid. Not because it\\'s necessary. They told me an invasive ultrasound I had done in 2017 had expired and I needed to have another one before my procedure. Had that done. They sprung a painful biopsy on me during an office visit. An office visit they said I needed to come in for to go over the same info I told them last year in order for BCBS to cover the procedure. As far as the biopsy, another requirement of BCBS. Then 10 days before my procedure they called me and told me I needed to come in again for an invasive screening. I had the same screening 14 months prior. Again, they told me it had expired. A screening that according to my age, I only need every 5 years. I\\'d also like to mention Traci told me the biopsy was needed to rule out cancer. Why would I need to have both a biopsy and a screening to rule out cancer, especially when I had the same screening 14 months prior. I trusted them and I can\\'t believe I put myself through all of that. They have refused to provide me with the information that my imaging and screening from 2017 were expired and BCBS required updated information. They have also refused to explain why they put me through a painful biopsy. Not to mention the time I took off work and the incoming bills from their office, a radiologist, and the lab. I will also mention they use an out of network anesthesiologist. I\\'ve already confirmed with his billing office they don\\'t balance bill and will accept the in-network allowable as payment in full, but they wouldn\\'t give me that information in writing so I\\'m a bit skeptical. I believe her name is Kelly, but she didn\\'t even know what balancing billing meant. She told me she\\'d balance bill me for any co-insurance or deductibles. That\\'s not balance billing! I am fully aware it\\'s my responsibility to verify my own insurance benefits/requirements. Shame on me. Fair warning to other women to double check anything Paradise Valley OB-GYN says is required! Hoping other women do not end up going through a similar experience as mine. I told them I would remove this review if they would verify the information they told me was accurate. There\\'s a reason this review is still posted here and elsewhere.EDIT - I am updating a 5 star review from a year ago to a 1 star?? HOW terrible!!!  My 5 star remains below...\\n\\nIt is with a heavy heart I write this review.  I never understood why this restaurant got such low ratings until lately.  I cannot keep my mouth shut any longer and will no longer consider myself a regular.  Today we arrived and noticed the restaurant dirty.  And they no longer had sweetener other than sugar (asked for Splenda).  When asked we were told \"the economy is bad.\"  OK no biggie.  So order: biscuits and gravy, eggs over hard and crispy bacon.  Biscuits are like dry discks and WHAT is in the gravy?  Mushrooms or sausage?  So rubbery I dont know.  Eggs are runny and bacon is just fat.  Sent it back.  Comes back the bacon has OBVIOUSLY been microwaved to sawdust and the eggs are FRIED to a CRISP!  I was shocked.  It was repulsive.  I kid you not, I fed it to my dogs who were out in the car and they werent not even thrilled to have bacon!  The waitress even told us when I mentioned the bacon that the \"quality has gone down.\"  UMMM OK!  Kicker - we were charged for it.  So long Egg & I.WORST car rental experience ever! \\n\\nTo begin with, 1 hour waiting in line and ending up talking to a screen. Everything was not working, driver\\'s license scanner was not working, not able to find a specific car model, etc.. The screen does not work at all, why don\\'t Hertz change it? And then waited in line again in order to talk to the only live agent and was told that I should use the screen instead of BOTHERING her, because they are apparently super busy. With those low efficient screens, 1 hour per customer, of course, people are lining up. But should you complain to your employer instead of your customer?\\n\\nThen, the agent was trying to sell some car insurance, I said no because I already purchased the rental insurance from Priceline.com when I booked the car. The agent was basically yelling at me that this was not Hertz insurance. I still don\\'t understand why she was so angry that I did not purchase their $24 per day Hertz insurance. According to her, choosing filling the gas tank myself is a crime. \\n\\nThe specific model I requested was taken, again, I was told because they are super busy, they could not accommodate every customer\\'s request. Rude customer service, not being courteous at all, no \"please\", \"thank you\" or \"you are welcome\", etc.place is nice, food on the plate no so. . have not been yelping very long only a few reviews but this is my fist one star. Had the Dungeness crab rivioli and the veal scaloppinil  dinners.  Have hade veal many times for much less $.The crab dish hade  very very little crab meat and the taste was worth less than the one star. First time I have been let down by yelp.2 Pork Shao Lung Boa - 16.00\\n1 Shiu Mai - 9.00\\n1 Snow Pea Leaf - 28.00  ==  Yes Twenty Eight\\n1 Iced Tea - 4.50\\n\\nTotal Lunch (Not Including Tax) $62.16\\n\\nMSG bomb all over.\\n\\nMost chinese ppl would find this restaurant offensive.  I only ate here b/c I saw Mr Wynn himself eating lunch here.  I wouldn\\'t come back.  They also have a terrible service issue.   More specifically, the servers standing there.  Not servicing the customers.  No need to bring your own soy sauce...food\\'s salty enough.Do not go here! I went here with my sister to look for engagement rings for my now fiancé. I walked in and was met by 2 older ladies who seemed bothered by my presence to begin with. I was beaming with excitement because I was going to be making a HUGE decision in my life and also throwing down a huge chunk of my hard earned money. The ladies ( both sporting rings on all fingers) asked what I was looking for and showed me some outrageously priced rings. They asked my budget to which I gave them my reply (I worked my ass off for the money I had and I was convinced that it was a very generous amount) ...THEY BOTH LAUGHED...\\nOne said \" If that\\'s the kind of diamond you want you\\'ll have to have bring more money than that.\"\\nI was very embarrassed.  They wanted me to open up a line of credit for the diamond alone. They then realized I wasn\\'t buying a $10,000 ring and lost interest in me so I left. \\nGentlemen, GO TO THE SHANE COMPANY! They asked my budget and made me feel like a king, everybody is so nice. I left there designing a beautiful ring (which I still brag about) and all just under my budget.\\n\\nDon\\'t waste your time like I did! Off Scottsdale road and acoma, one mile south of bell road!Stay as far away from this business as you can. Quoted me $398 for a week with a full size vehicle. Dropped the car off and was billed $687 with no explanation. I sent an email to the company to address my concerns and they did not write back. I tried to report them to the BBB but they are not an accredited company. This is a smoke and mirror operation and I will turn them into the state for unfair and deceptive trade practices.\\nWhat a total rip off organization.I had one facial and it was great. However Michelle did not show up for my second appointment and the woman who had an appointment prior to me was also stood up. I texted and called and no response. Not a good way to treat loyal customers. Apparently this is a pattern of the owner who not only does not show up for scheduled appointments but then doesn\\'t even have the courtesy to call and apologize.This firm place a facebook add indicating no service fee.\\nI called and made an appointment, prior to appointment I received a call asking if I would mind changing from Friday to Monday. Since my plumbing problem was not urgent I agreed.\\nWell monday came and at nood when I not received call I called them and the lady I talked too didn\\'t seem to know about my service request but said she would contact plumber. I didn\\'t hear from plumber and they simply were a no show. I would not suggest use of this serviceThis one goes out to you Camilla and Jan of the floor department and the idiotic estimator you guys sent to my front door. If you have a quirky older home that your flipping, DO NOT USE RC WILEY FLOORING. Their sales people in store will sell grand stories of possibility and luxury, but alas their installers are committed to minimal work, and they will not work with you if there are cracks in your subfloor. Basically, I gave RC wiley 2,000 dollars and took out a $4,000 line of credit and they showed up day of install and refused to put the floors in because they were worried about cracks in my subfloor. I then got them to reevaluate and at least take my tile up to see how bad  it was and they balked again. My biggest complaint is why would you ever get this far in the process, if you guys are incapable of handling any sub flooring issues. THIS SHOULD BE THE FIRST THING OUT OF YOUR MOUTHS WHEN PEOPLE COME TO YOU ASKING FOR INSTALL. \\n\\nThe direct consequences of RC Wiley refusing to instal \\n1) the line of credit I withdrew would make it impossible for me to get a low interest rate for another loan at a better company capable of installing floors.\\n2) Due to them delaying and refusing to install my house was empty for longer than necessary and my house was broken into. \\n3) I will never shop at any RC Wiley ever, your furniture looks like last years Motel 8 anyway. \\n-Also tell your sales rep who sent me business cards, \"so i can recommend her to my friends and family,\" ya obviously thats not happening.Beyond poor....1 star is too many,from start to finish....left and then had to go have a great meal across the hall at Scarpetto....This is a real Tourist Trap with poor service We guess the great location keeps this place in business...If you are going to spend several hundred for dinner it should be special ...this place is surely about just taking your money...First, let me share that I\\'ve spent close to 200 nights in Las Vegas, mostly in hotels ranging from cheap to very pricey (depending largely on who was paying-- me or my company!) so i speak from a lot of firsthand experience.\\n\\nTo cut to the chase: \\n\\nLIKED:\\n1. off the strip\\n2. next to Bass Pro Shop\\n3. rustic environment (except for the very plain and unmemorable room)\\n4. easy parking\\n5. relatively inexpensive\\n\\nDISLIKED:\\n1. The room\\'s air conditioner/heater sounded like a jet engine (and management didn\\'t care) so you HAD to wear ear plugs to sleep\\n2. Small refrigerator had been removed from its ugly, scratched furniture leaving a big hole.\\n3. We were told that \"NO\" hotels in Las Vegas had refrigerators or microwaves in them (I know this to be wildly inaccurate), but if we wanted a refrigerator it would cost $15 a day! (I can buy one for $100)\\n3. Bathtub/shower wall had small chunks taken out of it\\n3. No exhaust fan in the bathroom\\n4. Ancient, small tube (CRT) TV in room. Very 1980\\'s. Or even 1970\\'s.\\n5. Walls were VERY thin-- you can easily hear the content of your neighbor\\'s conversations\\n6. Awful smoke from lobby made it all the way into our room on the 4th floor at night, so the room STANK while you were trying to sleep\\n7. Ridiculous daily $4.99 \"resort fee\" for stuff we did not need (airport shuttle), which actually was closer to $6 after taxes.\\n8. $11 daily fee for internet!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME? CHARGING $11 FOR WiFI IN 2014? \\n(Or you can sit in the horribly smoke-filled lobby and use it for free while getting lung cancer. You decide.)\\n9. So after the fees, your $59/night room is now closer to $80-- and there are nicer places in L.V. for that which also get you free breakfast and free WiFi.\\n\\nSome nice staff (Teddy, for example), some that were mostly unfriendly. \\nThey nickel and dime you for things that should be included.\\nWill not be back.\\nI do not recommend The Silverton.This place decided to cancel taco Tuesday on Tuesday! That\\'s like having your kids run downstairs on Christmas to find no presents under the tree because Christmas was canceled! This sucksHave been going here since moving to Phoenix 1 1/2 years ago. Previous visit was given wrong order (1 item). Few days later mgr issued a credit to use at later date. Went back few nights ago prior to dinner rush. After waiting 35 minutes asked clerk for my food (again 1 burrito). Was advised given to wrong person, but found it for me. Got home again with the wrong item. While there during my lengthy wait noticed many people returning orders that were filled wrong. Food here is good, NOT great & definitely not worth being abused continually by the inept staff. Phoenix is loaded with great Mexican food & this one is not worth a return visit.Made a mistake going back tonight. Forgot about how bad service was. Will NEVER go back.horrible food,when the owner is not there what do you expect, try to bring you in with cheap sign but when you get the  bill its a surprise. way better pl,aces to eat breakfast and lunch and they only take cash. How can anyone screw up breakfast?The buffet at the Bellagio has gone downhill in a big way. Had the weekend brunch here and the selection was not all that great and what was there was often cold and bland. Service was also not very good. I remember this place being so much better years ago when I first came here. For $25/head ($30 if you want champagne), I expect a lot better selection and quality. Don\\'t waste your money here.Was given an offer for employment, took 3 months for the manager to get back and decided to hire me with only 3 weeks left before going back to school. Told the manager that I would be attending school in a matter of weeks so the resignation form would be submitted after working for only 1 week and she said that she was fine, but after turning in my resignation form, tried to chew me out and claimed that she never was told about my schedule and terminated me on the spot.Horrible horrible horrible.  Didnt have our car, talked me into a $50 upgrade which I agreed to, then advised me the upgraded car wasnt available. So now I\\'ve been waiting for over an hour for the Advantage people to get another car ready.  The line is 15 customers long with only two nitwits working.  Never again with these clowns.Super sad experience here  I went in on a Friday afternoon second visit here came here one other time and loved my nails! Those ones were done by a younger Asian lady who was VERY nice and this review has nothing to do with her. Back to that Friday afternoon I went in for a full set and a pedicure. Both services were done by an older Asian lady with glasses pedicure was mediocre I wasn\\'t expecting super perfect feet but she left my toenails too long looks like they weren\\'t even cut and when I asked her if she could do it shorter she brushed it off and ignored me. On to the shape of my full set I asked for coffin and a younger gentlemen did the shape of my nails I love his work! They then switched off to the older Asian lady again to paint my nails she did SUCH A MESSY QUICK JOB! She finished my nails and put them under a lamp to finish drying and she went on to work on another customer. As I was getting my stuff to walk out I hit my nails on the machine used to dry them I said I was sorry and the lady literally rolled her eyes and left me siting there at that moment I had so much anxiety and I just wanted to leave! She finished with the other customer came back to me repainted all the nails I had messed up again rushing through it all! On my pinky nail when she was about to apply the top coat after the 2 coats she barely even let dry. The clear top coat had some sort of black residue that left black streaks on my nail she immediately became frustrated and just put yet another coat of the nude polish I chose to cover up the streak!!!When she did so the other coats of polish she had put down and not waited to dry became shriveled!!!! She looked soooo pissed took off all the polish on my pinky nail and did it yet another time! As soon as my nails were dry I ran out of there! I had so much anxiety that I left my shoes! Super bad service I will never be returning there! Just shows that when you\\'re in a bad mood all the work you do is bad too! It is now Sunday and my thumb nail has broken! & I paid this little shop 80$ of my money I am very upset and would advise everyone to avoid this place way too over priced to walk out upset about the money you spent.BEWARE!  I hope you read this before you book a car rental with ACE.   Let me share my experience....we booked ACE through Hotwire, which we thought was reputable.  Once we took the shuttle from the airport baggage area, we found out that ACE is not a part of the main stream rentals at the airport and we had to take a second shuttle to the ACE location.  While we were waiting for the second shuttle, we noticed there were signs with numbers, but no indication as to what represented these numbers.  When the ACE van (that only seats 7) arrived, everyone poured over to the van and people that just arrived were seated before the rest of us.  A driver from another company informed us that the #6 was the line for ACE....who knew?Mind you, we were waiting in line under the sun and heat. \\n\\nOnce we arrived, we stood in line for a long time.  We were told that because our flight departed at 6am (which would require a 2 hour earlier drop off) we had to deliver the car back to ACE the day before we departed.  We could leave the keys in the car at ACE, but we are responsible if someone stole the car.  Nice options.  Needless to say, we cancelled are flighting with Hotwire for a credit.\\n\\nAs we took the return shuttle back to the McCarran Airport rental area, another couple told the driver they would never rent again.  The cars were not filled up with gas, they were dirty.  They said the minute someone returned the vehicle, the ACE rep would drive it around and not fill it up or clean it. \\n\\nAnother man, called the company he used to book the car and asked them to no longer include ACE in their list of car rentals. \\n\\nThe experience was not good.  Trust me, you can get cheaper prices through Dollar or Budget.   Good Luck!I\\'ve watched an older lady working here give customers an attitude, then kick the customer out if they didn\\'t pull out their ID fast enough. Another time, she accused this man of hiding his ID photo with his thumb and kicked him out when he moved his thumb. Another time, she didn\\'t ID a girl who was clearly underage but then gave the man who was behind her in line a hard time, even though he looked at least 40. This woman is rude and I avoid this location solely because of her. She thought my ID was fake and bent it until it cracked, then when I pulled out my passport she thought that was fake too. Don\\'t go to this location. You\\'ll just get hassled.I hate giving bad reviews (which is why virtually all of my reviews are 4+), but this location is quite disappointing. The last 4 times I\\'ve ordered from there over the past few months, they\\'ve given me undercooked (read: pink, with very soggy skin and a chewy texture). I had strips too and when I tried to break it in half, all that happened was the breading slid off.\\n\\nI\\'m not going to go there just to have to spend time in line, bring it home, take a bite, throw it out and hope I\\'m okay over the next few hours. It\\'s a shame because I really like Popeyes.I\\'ve historically been a fan of DWR, but after a recent purchase through this location I do not plan to patronize them again. I ordered some items during the Knoll sale, and what began as a pleasant experience turned sour.\\n\\nIssues pertaining to shipping and communication: the account executive I worked with did not properly update my home address in the system after I had corrected it with her (I had to correct it with freight), I received a heads-up from DWR that white glove shipment would be scheduled AFTER the item already arrived (the freight company called the day before and I was luckily available at home during the delivery window with 24-hour notice), and I never received notice or tracking info of items that came through the mail.\\n\\nThe worst part: I was overcharged over $800, and had to reach out to them about it. The account executive didn\\'t even care to update me on the status of the refund until I reached out to her--again.\\n\\nI wrote to corporate about the matter two weeks ago, and still no reply. This is a testament to how much they care about their customers.\\n\\nRemember: the DWR studios are simply showrooms. They do not stock items, and customers still have to go through an ordering process. Knoll, Herman Miller, Vitra, and other fine manufacturers are available through many online retailers like Lumens and Yliving with free shipping, no tax, and world\\'s better customer service. I\\'ve had seamless experiences with them, and would recommend going that route over ordering through the DWR studio any day.This place sucks a$@ no one should have to be subjected to the harassment of the management and the employee/token Mexican who is steady trying to win employee of the second by trying to enforce rules that no one abides by! My suggestion is to sleep in your car, under the closest bridge, or the nearest park bench!Sat in and was ignored in the \"drive through\" for 15+ minutes before someone pulled up in the 3rd (labeled exit) lane and was immediately helped.\\n\\nBeyond poor customer service and attention only made worse by the lack of organization and order kiosk in the drive through. \\n\\nStanding and taking orders works great if you implement a system like in and out has, not so much if you lack any order and drive up windows for your \"drive though\". \\n\\nWon\\'t be back and won\\'t be recommending.For some reason they always they super bad with patients \\nI have to take water and hold it for and 1 hr is terrible they always give the must stupid explanations\\nI don\\'t get it WHY!!!! They give you in appointment time is they going to attending you wherever time they wand\\nBut if we get late we have to re-schedule the appointment \\nWhat we can do with the horrible horrible service  GOODYEAR AND AVONDALE are the same serviceHorrible. The food itself is so so at best, basically cheaply made and overpriced. If you order delivery good luck on them getting your order right or .....even completing the order. Call in for a manager and they\\'re always \"too busy\" and couldn\\'t care less once you pay. Take your money to another pizzaria, there\\'s plenty of better places out there.HUGE SCAM!!!!   \\n\\nThis place over charged me for services for my wife.  They charged us for a root canal and redoing fillings but they used the wrong amount of insurance allocation on the dental codes and billed us for a higher amount.   Then they told me I was crazy when I matched the dental codes with the insurance.   They made me feel stupid for being concerned.   They said it will all make sense later when we get our explanation of benefits.  I never received that explanation of benefits.   \\n\\nSo i waited months and called my insurance and low and behold they ripped us off.  I called them and threatened to sue and report them and they quickly refunded the $173.00 they overcharged us.   \\n\\nAs a consumer it is very hard to understand medical billing and that is exactly how they take advantage of you.  By reading the other comments it looks like they ripped off many people.   Please stay away from this business.  Someone should report them to the IRS and the authorities.Wouldn\\'t even give 1 star!  Horribly tasting food and really bad service! \\nThe waiter was not bad but he should tell the customer if something we\\'re ordering is going to be too much for a person to eat..  While they server placed the fajitas,  2/4 brocollis fell out.. They forgot the add the 1/3 part of the fajitas - the sweet potato! \\nThe Quinoa Super Bowl was so bad! \\nOver all horrible experience!  Never going back here..Don\\'t ever go through Ace!!! My husband and I visited Vegas this week and went to ace to rent a car. We were stuck waiting two hours for a car to be returned that we had previously reserved. Everyone else was waiting as well. Once we received the car the front wheel well was broken and scraped and made a loud noise the entire time we drove. There was a dent in the back bumper as well. The girl at the front desk was extremely rude. When I tried to find out what was going on I was ignored because she was too busy playing on her phone. I also witnessed a family that noticed the license plate on their rental had expired back in 2017. I then saw a employee put a new license plate on it!!! Which I\\'m assuming isn\\'t for that vehicle. VERY SHADY BUSINESS!! Definitely a big scam. We knew they were lying because their lips were moving. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE BEWARE!!!Worst fucking people I\\'ve ever dealt with lol. Luis is nice, James is a dick head who tricked me into something I didn\\'t need done. He made it sound urgent and like the other mechanics I had talked to YESTERDAY, had given me false advice. I hear they do this a lot, unfortunately it was too late for me to change my mind on the services. Please don\\'t go here, they\\'re sketchy and untrustworthy. JW auto took care of me and were so genuine. I will never go to Midas again. \\n\\nOH GUESS WHAT GUYS!!! These inconsiderate disgraceful men just called me to let me know they forgot to give me a free oil change voucher for my next visit. Synthetic oil for my 2005 Car. WHICH I DONT FUCKING NEED. These men are worthless. Watched me cry about the pricing and still went ahead and made up that I had to get my rotors replaced. I was at a mechanics just yesterday who said my rotors were fine. And to add to this- they didn\\'t even tell me why my rotors were needing to be replaced, didn\\'t show me any wear, just pressed about the fact that they needed to be replaced. They\\'re scum bags DO NOT TRUST THESE SKETCHY ASSES THEY JUST WANT YOUR MONEY!!!!I would give 0 stars if,possible. I\\'m making a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. These people are liars. I spoke with Stanley in June about my move from Vegas to Boston. He asked me for a pick up date, and that is when I informed him that I would need everything delivered by August 1, so I asked him what date would be good for pick up to make this happen. He told me that a cross country move would take anywhere from 7 to 12 days or so, so in order to adjust for that we should make the initial pick up on the 19th or 20th of July. I said okay, then asked him what would happen if it gets there earlier, since I won\\'t be able to receive the items until August 1? He assured me that the drivers would contact me beforehand and if i wasn\\'t available for pick up then they would place it in storage and set a redelivery date of August 1 with me. Then...i had to call and remind them of my pick up date. After pick up, I called them a few days before I flew over to Boston for the Aug 1 delivery date trying to get an idea if they knew the time of when my stuff was going to get to Boston. No response. Called the consecutive days and even emailed with no response. Freaking out in Boston now, I finally get a hold of someone on Sunday, Aug 2nd, the day after my delivery date. She informs me that I need to call Dispatch to figure out when they are going to deliver to me and Dispatch is closed Sundays. No one up until that point informed me to contact Dispatch to get this information. At this point, I, along with my elder parents, were renting hotels last minute, and then finally decided to sleep on the floor of my apartment to save money. Got a hold of dispatch on Monday and Ellie tells me she will find out and call me back. I call her back after 30 minutes, she says she will call me back in 2 hours. I call her back after 2 hours and she tells me she still needs to talk to her boss to get an idea of a delivery date and time. Then she tells me that she would call me before end of business day to tell me if she has news or tell me if she has no news, but she will call me. Frustrated I call the main office trying to get in touch with Stanley, and apparently he is not there, but they are aware of my situation and will get back to me, okay? NO, NOT OKAY, so I ask for the manager. When she gets on the phone, i ask who i am speaking with and she goes the manager....yeah i get that, what\\'s your name?! She says Izzy or Bizzy and then proceeds to tell me that I signed a contract with the movers and they are within their 21 days to deliver my items to me. When i state that 21 days should be sometime this week, she states that it is actually 21 days from when i state i can receive the shipment, so basically from aug 1 to the 21st, since i stated i could receive them on the 1st of august. She tells me it\\'s my fault for telling the guys that came to pick up my stuff that I could receive the stuff on Aug 1 and not immediately or else it would be delivered to me by the 1st....no, no i discussed this with stanley, hence the pick up on the 19th etc. etc. and she keeps arguing with me that it is my fault i told the pick up guys that i could receive the stuff on aug 1. I start telling her this is insane that I have to sleep on the floor of my apartment, and I can\\'t even take a proper shower, I don\\'t have my shampoo and things....she instantly replies, \"well shampoo is not that expensive and sleeping on the floor is not the most horrible thing in the world.\" This lady deserves the freaking nobel peace prize in being a subhuman piece of ish. Anyway, I am pretty much in a full on heated argument at this point, and I inform her that this is not what Stanley and I discussed and she denies that Stanley told me what he did because they don\\'t have storage in Boston, they only have storage in Vegas, and if they redelivered to me I would have to pay a huge fee, and I should know all this because I signed the contract. Obviously this conversation is going back and forth and not leading to a date of delivery or any sense since they are absolutely denying accountability or responsibility of their mess up, so we end the conversation with her stating that she will go through the tape recordings of our conversions and that dispatch is working really hard right now to get my stuff over to me as soon as possible. Guess what the kicker is...........I find out my stuff is still in Las Vegas! And Ellie from dispatch never called me back at the end of business day. Wait wait, there is more! My brother goes to their office the next morning, and they tell him they still haven\\'t even scheduled a date for my things to ship out! So we pulled my stuff out of storage and had to hire another set of movers to get my things over here. And they won\\'t give me my money back because they are charging me for storage in their warehouse. \\n\\nI know, this seems crazy for it to be true, but it is. I\\'m filling this complaint to the BBB, so you can check it out there as well!This review has nothing to do with the actual chiropractic care, which was great. It has everything to do with Lisa and how she handled the billing and contract and subsequent conversations. Long story short, got signed up for their monthly plan using a flex spending account. Was told I could cancel by submitting a written letter to cancel. Used the Joint for a couple months then got busy and didn\\'t use again until I needed to and found out my flex account had been shut off, and the joint kept billing. My flex spending company said they needed itemized receipts to turn the card back on...and Lisa initially refused to print the receipts until she got the $$ for the months that the card was shut off. I explained the situation and asked why I wasn\\'t notified that the card wasn\\'t working and she said she tried calling (she hadn\\'t) but she \"is not allowed to leave voicemails\" which frankly didn\\'t matter because she never called in the first place. I asked for the franchisee\\'s number and she stated they were corporately owned, and refused to give me their contact info because \"they would refer you back to me\". I told her I\\'d find the number myself (which I did). The best part?  She called me and left a couple of voicemails!!\\n\\nIf you need to use the joint, don\\'t sign up for their plans...well at least with Lisa.Well the selections for our breakfast were great, our server was fast and friendly. And where else are you going to get a breakfast for $4.99. However, my husband and I both got salad\\'s as well and half way through his salad, little bugs were coming out of his salad. I freaked out and asked one of the servers to take the plate, she said she would tell the manager, It took about 10 minutes for a manager to get to our table, and she says sorry can i make you another salad. Are you kidding me. Who wants to eat here when bugs are in your food. So disgusting. Due, to this we will not be back.  The reason they get one star is because of how long it took to respond to the situation, and the fact there were bugs in the food. YUCKAbsolutely terrible. Dr. Zak is very unprofessional and hateful. There is a difference between \\'not sugar coating things\\' and being completely inappropriate. I went to her through my entire pregnancy and aftercare but I have had ENOUGH. She is terrible and has zero bedside manner and refuses to answer questions or help. You always wait at least an hour to see her because she\\'s \"running late\". If I could give zero stars I would. I will never return to that office again and I hope no other woman has to go through it either. Do not go here if you are pregnant.Horrible location. Poor service! I came in to upgrade my sons line and there was a wait. Totally understandable. When it was our turn we were approached and told that were after the lady that was behind us because what they wanted done was simpler. That I do not understand. Everyone\\'s problems are equally important however to the staff there, that was not the case. Then when they finally got to us to upgrade I was told they couldn\\'t bc there was a past due. That was not true. I had the text from Verizon confirming the payment however since it\\'s a Sunday it wouldn\\'t post in the system till tomorrow so there was nothing he could do. Wrong again. I called Verizon 1800 and they said they could stop the payment and I could pay over the phone then process my upgrade so I could pick it up first thing tomorrow with a text letting me know it was there. I would not recommend visiting this store. Call Verizon 1800 and save yourself the frustration.First time in a long time I have stopped in at a Mc Donald\\'s, the staff was friendly. I get my order from the drive thru get home and my hamburgers are burnt...Unfortunately I wanted to love this place but did not have a first good visit. I ordered a salad that came in two containers, it was pretty much half a bag of spinach with a light sprinkle of strawberries and a little bacon, a couple of sliced mushrooms all swimming in boring spinach. The dressing tasted store bought, nothing special. They forgot my chicken so I called to have it removed from bill and they wanted me to drive back 20 min to get it refunded on card. I didn\\'t have time so I paid for a chicken salad but never got any chicken nor a refund. They offered me to go back for another salad but I\\'m not close by so it\\'s not conviniente for me.\\n\\nI ordered 3 pastries and they were all like what you get at Costco, nothing special. I also ordered a French Onion soup, it tasted like dirty water. :( The cheese on the salad was meant for the soup but it was so little that I put on the salad for added taste. \\n\\nJust drive a couple more minutes and go to Cheesecake or Wildflower for a real meal. \\n\\nI don\\'t like leaving bad reviews but I really didn\\'t enjoy anything that I purchased and just felt like my $24 bill was just a waste.i fell asleep during the show...  and i\\'ve never fallen asleep in any cirque shows before.  \\n\\nwell for one, i\\'m not a beatles fan, so it was more difficult to get me engaged with the production.  \\n\\nthe acrobatics did not live up to other cirque shows\\' standards.\\n\\njust glad i had a glass of wine in hand to get me through the show.Called & made an order, called 45 mins later & they said they were on their way. A carne asada burrito doesn\\'t take 1/2 hr, especially when delivery is less than a quarter block. Unacceptable, I cancelled the order. Don\\'t waste your time ordering from them, there\\'s better Mexican places.Do not let the name change from WAMU to Chase fool you, your money is not safe with Chase. With Chase in charge of WAMU, I suffered an identity theft which the fraud unit of WAMU detected and warned me about. Chase subsequently denied reimbursement because they could not figure out how the theft occured. Basically, accused me of theft.Sushi Rock is one of those trendy places you end up eating at multiple times.  It\\'s like the first place that pops into the minds of people who have never had sushi but think it would be fun to try.  Thankfully I now know enough of other sushi places in the area that I can steer these people in another direction.\\n\\nEvery time I eat here I get sick to my stomach within a few hours.  As in, rushing home and cancelling plans or driving really fast on the way back because I need my home bathroom NOW.  I wouldn\\'t be so graphic if it weren\\'t for the fact that this has also happened to friends of mine, and that I know from extensive adventurous eating sushi consumption that this is NOT at all normal nor some sort of intolerance I have for sushi.  Heck, I\\'m the queen of rare steaks, ordering tuna spine marrow up at the bar (at another sushi place), and \"it\\'s probably fine if you just microwave it\" and I refuse to eat here ever again.\\n\\nI don\\'t know what the problem is--poor fish quality, issues in the kitchen, etc.--but maybe it\\'s not an issue all the time, which is why some people seem to like it.  Or they have stronger stomachs than mine.  But it\\'s happened enough times it\\'s no longer just coincidence.Ordered lettuce wraps. They were served to our table dirty. With a sizable clump of black dirt on one of them. Sent them back of course. Fresh lettuce was then served. New York style pizza. It was okay. Nothing fabulous. Parmesan cheese is not fresh, Unfortunately. With all of the amazing restaurants in Vegas, it is highly likely we will not return to this one.Terrible service. The women that work here are not friendly at all! Not to mention, they are overly adamant about no picture taking. I was in with my sister dress shopping because our mother was over seas and would not be back until just before the wedding. The lady would not even let me take a picture to send to my own mother! Her reasoning was because we could go make the dress or have someone else make it... Like what the actual hell. I highly recommend NOT going here. Brides and Belles in Reedsburg is where it\\'s at!Pulled in to this restaurant en route to San Diego...I have lived in Chicago all my life and the Rallys on the Southside moved twice as fast as this place! I mean 20 min in the walk up for two entrees?? I got full on my pop before my food came. Cheese wasn\\'t melted on my burger..smh..Come on yall...we gotta do betterNot a bad massage, but if you\\'re looking for relaxation, do not even waste your time.  \\n\\nI\\'ve had three massages here over the last six years.  The first was an introductory rate, and was just average, but I was feeling somewhat relaxed when it was over.  Then the receptionist started in on all the membership options and how, if I didn\\'t join and commit to having the $49 deducted from my credit card (which I didn\\'t possess at the time) each month, it would cost me an insane amount for any future massages.\\n\\nThe second time was more than a year later, and I\\'d forgotten I\\'d been there previously.  They had my name and address in their computer, so they said I had to join if I wanted the $49 rate.  When I said I couldn\\'t join at that time, they said it\\'d be $90.  I said forget it, and they said they\\'d still have to charge me for the session.  Once again I said forget it and was about to leave when a supervisor said I could have the $49 rate one more time without joining.  My 60-minute massage lasted 48 minutes and was below average.\\n\\nFinally, three years later a friend gave me a gift card for a free massage.  The manager was downright nasty and said, for the entire waiting room to hear as though she wanted to embarrass me, that if the whole $90 wasn\\'t paid on the card that I couldn\\'t get the massage nor my friend\\'s money back.  Turned out it she did pay the $90, so I got my 43-minute massage with no apology or explanation, and I walked out totally frustrated.\\n\\nI\\'ve resolved never again to give them a cent of my money, and if the chain were smart they\\'d fire that horrible shrew of a manger.  But since the chain has made it clear they are far more interested in signing people up for long-term commitments than they are providing what they offer (a relaxing, 60-minute massage), it seems pretty obvious they are not smart and care not a bit about customer satisfaction.I\\'ve been to this mimis several times as I live close....I\\'ve never been impressed by the service.  Tho, today, Erik may have been the only redeeming quality about Mimi\\'s today.  He hustled and was friendly to everybody. \\nTo start, the hostess, Kimberly was snotty. I was eating solo on a Friday just before 11am. She told me to sit and asked my name. I was the only person there at the time!! It took 8 mins to set up a table for me. I would hate to see her/them in action on a busy weekend morning. \\nI always order the pommes Benedict but with muffins instead of potatoes. It use to be on the menu as florentine but has been replaced. For some reason, the kitchen doesn\\'t want to make my breakfast this way for me, tho they reluctantly did. This dish was really the only reason to come to Mimi\\'s. Guess I don\\'t need to come here again now.Too bad I could not give 1/2 star! I used to make the trek to Bellagio Buffet when I was visiting Vegas but I had not done so for the last 7 years because my friends do like Buffets--I love sampling different dishes and preparations.\\n\\nI am glad I didn\\'t convince my friends to try Bellagio.\\n\\nBellagio has gone downhill food quality, variety, presentation, and freshness from sitting around too long so it barely rates above any buffet you would find anywhere. Only thing that has gone up is the price.\\n\\nI remember the first time that had venison that I enjoyed was at the Bellagio, that same dinner a long time ago had Beef Wellington, Pheasant, Leg of Lamb, and Prime Rib which was much leaner than my recent visit--seriously 30% fat is excessive.\\n\\nOvercooked vegetables, skimpy salad bar selection, 3 soups (tomato basil, chicken noodle, and tortilla soup) what?! Souplantation carries 10 soups and the chicken soup was more than chicken broth with noodle.\\n\\nDessert disaster! I couldn\\'t even salvage dinner with sweets. Poor selection and microscopic petit fours size pies---huh? I was not interested in appetizers at the end my meal.\\n\\nI could be more forgiving if weren\\'t that I remember when the Bellagio strived to uphold their reputation as having the best buffet in Vegas. \\n\\nAvoid disappointment, skip the line, high price and most importantly poor experience.  Avoid the Bellagio.It took about 40 minutes to get my car, when I already had a reservation. The agent was great, but there was only one of her. It makes little sense to staff a rental car location with one person. I wouldn\\'t recommend this location to anyone who is seeking to be timely.We were in Pickle Bills Aug 5th for my sisters birthday gathering.There were 7 in our party,we spent a significant amount of money for what we felt was Subpar service.Our Food was ok,nothing spectacular.I\\'ve  never experienced the level of unprofessionalism as we did with Alyssa!She was the Epitome of rudeness and unprofessionalism.My sister,who birthday we were celebrating,was attempting to order a drink,Alyssa cut her off in mid sentence to say \"I\\'ll be right right back I have to go cash them out!\"We all  looked at each other and said  that this was beyond Rude and Tacky!and thought,She can\\'t be serious!It was Unacceptable behavior and we should have left as it only got worse!She walked away a 2nd time to go to another table as if we were inconveniencing her by taking up too much of her time to place our orders!In addition,my significant other asked her \"what beers do you have on tap\"?Her response was as she pointed \"there\\'s a menu right there!This again  was Rude ,Tacky and Unprofessional!She failed to Impress!His mussels were cold,she didn\\'t offer an apology or ask if he wanted something else.She said\"you want me to take them off?Horrible Waitrress/service!!!She never brought his coleslaw until we were paying the check.She  then asked if he wanted it to go?This will be my last time patronizing this restaurant and paying for inferior service.I emailed Pickle Bills regarding my concerns,it isn\\'t a surprise that I wasn\\'t contacted.Oh no...do not let this team and his people near your property. We were selling our house last year and my goodness did these people help me rake the tenants over! These property managers really know how to rip people off! I joined Ted and his team of crackpots to basically steal their money. Ted will tell you one thing and then do another...he will spin your words, and will do whatever it takes to line his pockets. May he be judged by a higher being doing mobster work here on earth. You have been warned. Do not sign anything Ted writes up. He\\'s no good in my opinion.An hour into our visit to this faux British sports bar, and my boyfriend and my impression of this place was just as empty as our tabletop.  We came with high hopes to find a nice place to revisit for a beer and dinner but left with a pocket full of saved tip cash, a salty tongue and zero intentions of returning.\\n\\nWithout exaggerating, we literally sat at our bar booth for an hour before the rude waitress took our food order.  20-30 minutes later, food arrived to our table that we didn\\'t even order.  Keeping track, we\\'re nearly an hour and a half into sitting at this poor representation of a pub and we still haven\\'t tasted any food.  The reason for our commitment to this place was a pre-purchased Groupon.  Alas, my feeble attempt to use tactics as learned by Extreme Couponing had totally backfired.\\n\\nApparently to the waitress we weren\\'t deserving of an apology, instead the food runner apologetically returned with our correct order 10 minutes later while the moron waitress dodged our glances.\\n\\nAt this point I\\'m starving but not even my Blue Moon could help me win the battle with my terribly over-salted tuna melt.  Ok fine, in their defense, the french fries were good and the bartender was friendly but the meal was already ruined.\\n\\nMy advice would be to go for the french fries... but get them to-go... and from The Hard Rock next door, you\\'re sure to find similar tacky decor browsing the Motley Crue display without having to endure horrible service.As a big fan of pokebowls, I was a bit disappointed by the place. At this place you can either make your own bowl or choose one pre-made for about the same price (16-18$). I made one with spicy salmon, rice, and then added some usual veggies and garnishes such as cucumber, carrots, avocado. The result turned out unexpected. The bowl had wayyyy too much mayo and carrots and not enough of the other ingredients. It was very unbalanced and I found it too pricey for what it was. With tax and tips I paid 22$ for a pokebowl...\\n\\nAs for the service, the 2 staff were quite nice and made us try some sauce before ordering. However, towards the end, the waiter seemed to pressure us to leave when half of the restaurant was empty. \\n\\nDon\\'t think I would come back.Stopped by the store.  We had $1,000 in a FSA account we needed to spend.  We were ignored as other customers, who came in after us, were waited on.  After 15 minutes, we decided they must not want our $1,000 so we left.  Lots of paces to buy Rx glass....no need to be treated like this.admittedly it takes something (un)extraordinary for me to bother to write a review...maybe i was just here on a bad night, but unfortunately doubt i would try again\\n\\ncame here with a colleague on a Wednesday night and was seated upstairs.  3 different waitresses took various parts of our order which was more so symbolic of confusing service than over welcoming hospitality.  after i was served my 2 plates, my colleagues gristly tuna was served which she chose not to finish.  we also gave up on our brussel sprouts which did not come after 25 minutes so we decided to wrap things up and move on.\\n\\nthe tuna and brussel sprouts were at least removed from the bill\\n\\nalso the co2 was definitely not correct when our tap beers were poured despite our waitresses\\' instance that the bartender checked it after our initial commentI haven\\'t seen the PA I was supposed to have the appointment with yet. My appointment was at 3:45 and I am still sitting in the waiting room at 5pm. I have seen huge groups of people come and go, most of them walk ins with no appointment at all and still I wait. Deciding whether it is worth it to stay or if I should just leave since once I get called back it will be even more waiting. I already paid though so I suppose I am stuck for now. Oh look, someone else who just walked through the door five minutes ago just got taken back to see the doctor. I have checked with the receptionist twice and keep being told they are going to call me \"any minute now.\" Oh look more people that came in after me just finished their appointment and left. My other issue is that if I leave then the only other choice with my crappy insurance is health partners of Nevada and I\\'ve heard they are worse. I just heard the receptionist say something about how it is always like this and then she announced to the entire reception area that this wasn\\'t her problem for all of us waiting over an hour and we needed to take it up with someone else! This was completely unsolicited and she just said it to the entire room and then left for the day. Now the isn\\'t anyone at reception at all. I\\'m leaving, this is ridiculous.HORRIBLE !!!\\n....burgers are small..fries are terrible...and management sucks...even though they \\nhave call ahead seating if their busy they will just give your table away...and they close early most of the time...I\\'m disgusted with how terrible this practice is, everything from the office staff to the doctors.  \\n\\nI was having a chronic migraine (the reason I am seeing a neurologist) during my appointment. I threw up in the waiting room for an hour before being called. I then passed out trying to walk into the area where they take your blood pressure. The lack of knowledge displayed from the entire staff baffled me. Thankfully my mother was with me and able to assist in waiting for me to regain conciseness. \\nI then waiting for 20 minutes before anyone came in to check on me. \\nDoctor Lovell walked into the room, sat down with his back facing me, and began to type on his computer. He never looked at me or examined to ensure I was okay. \\nHe simply told me they could call an ambulance and send me to the ER. I told him these are how my migraines are and it was the reason I was coming to see him. \\nMy mother had to borrow a wheel chair to get me out of the office, not one member of the staff offered to assist. \\nI curled up in a ball in the wheel chair and waited for 5 minutes at the check-out desk as the receptionist was busy drinking her blender ball. \\nI had to wheel myself outside to throw up again because the pain was so bad.  \\nThe lack of knowledge, compassion, and assistance at this office is sick. Over everything, basic care for another human being was foreign to their entire staff. \\n\\nAlso.. You will wait 1 to 2 hours past your appointment time. \\n\\nPLEASE DO NOT GO HERE.I understand mistakes happen, but I have had poor customer service with even the service department taking 4 hours to change the oil on my car. The number provided was not \"disconnected\". Larry Miller has reached me several times to follow up with me after I purchased my vehicle. This dealership seems to be the only one not able to reach me. The check issue was not handled correctly. If an incorrect check was written, I am surprised it took a week for the mistake to be realized. Nonetheless, I have no ties to Arrowhead Honda and for that I am thankful.If I could give a zero I would. Went in to see the owner of the salon for some blonde bayalage and to cut off the ends of my hair. Came out with brassy hair and my very, long hair was just pass my shoulders. The color I was left with was this brown color with brassy highlights concentrated at the bottom. I called and the owner agreed to have me come back to fix the color and get what I originally wanted free of charge. In my second appointment, he basically spread that brassy, orange color all over my hair. It was horrifying. I had to go spend more money in another salon to try to fix the color I had. The new hairdresser couldn\\'t believe I had paid for such a color. Very disappointed and heartbroken.Now I know it\\'s Taco Bell, but this was ridiculous. Went through the drive thru and ordered 12 pack of tacos. First, while ordering someone had a headset and kept saying \"no\" through the entercom while the girl was taking out order. Then it took 10 minutes to get 12 regular tacos. Not acceptable. There was a lot of goofing off in the store and great that kids are working, but they need a manager that can keep them being respectful to their customers.Stayed here 3 nights. Rooms are very dated and really need a facelift, had to call for towels & toilet paper(although they were delivered promptly). Desk staff were just ok, bartender was rude. They advertise a shuttle that runs a continuous loop to hot spots but it is limited hours. Was told shuttle was not available both times we asked so we finally gave up & probably spent an extra $100 on taxis. No mini frig or microwave in room which is pretty standard for rooms in this $$ range. Just not good.NOT RECOMMENDED!!!!    0/10   -Wish I could give this business 0 stars.\\nUnprofessional staff, absolutely rude during party time. The bartenders were so rude, they were not even paying attention to the guests. I am so heartbroken for even organizing a party here. Some of the banquet hall staff members was just chilling with the bartender, talking, and one of the bald guys with glasses was actually downright offensive in his mannerisms, the way he was dealing with the guests. \\nOne of the older gentlemen in the party accidentally was about to walk behind the bar (he had a drink or two), and was stopped as soon as he was told by the bartender without any confrontation, but this overzealous staff member (they bald guy with the glasses) started chanting the Arizona statute for what happens when someone walks behind the bar like there was a crime in progress, and he wasn\\'t even serving drinks, he was actually just chilling with the bartender, distracting him by just non nonchalantly talking.\\nMy suggestion to anyone who\\'s planning to organize a party here, spend some more money and go somewhere else, the staff here is downright unprofessional and rude. They standard of providing service is not up to the mark as compared to so many other fantastic banquet halls in Chandler, Phoenix, Scottsdale etc.\\nThanks for reading!I recently was a guest at the Mandalay Bay Resort, attending the PPAI show Jan 10-14.\\nI had an email confirmation for reservations to the Rx Boiler Room.  This was a client dinner, I was hosting a total of 10 people.\\nI called about a week prior to my visit to increase the party of 8 to 10.  Also, when I arrived to Las Vegas, I checked in with the concierge desk and a lady called, and again, confirmed my reservation for 10 people at the RX Boiler Room on Tues Jan 12 at 6:30 pm.\\n\\nWhen I arrived at 6:20 that evening, I was in shock when I saw a sign saying \"closed for a private party\".  I spoke with the manager and while he was apologetic, did not seem sincere. He blamed the 3rd party online system for the error instead of accepting this was a huge mistake, causing me great embarrassment in front of my customers.\\nHe said my reservations were not here, but rather downstairs at RM Seafood.  Forgive me, my clients and I live in Boston, MA where we have the finest and freshest seafood in the country.  I would not fly to the desert to have seafood.  \\n\\nHaving no other choice (as all restaurants were booked for the evening), we were escorted downstairs.  The manager there took care of us at first.  But after our order was taken, it was hard to find a server or manager. Our service was slow.  The food was mediocre at best.  We were half way through our dinner before the wine came (and we ordered it as soon as we sat down).  We waited about 20 min after we finished to find a server to bring us a dessert menu.  He advised that the kitchen was backed up and it would be 20-30 min if we ordered dessert.  This was unacceptable after already having waited 20 minutes.  The bill came to nearly $1700, of which the manager took care of the wine - approx. $200.  And this was not something he offered, I had to ask for it.  While we finished up our wine, the server brought us 2 key lime desserts to share (conveniently while I was signing the check).\\n\\nIn hindsight, I should have asked for more, as our experience was just short of awful.  I am in the sales and service industry.  When my company messes up, we take care of our clients.  I believe that people can make mistakes, but it is how you correct them that shows true integrity and commitment to your customers.\\n\\nWhen I return for this convention next year, I will reconsider where I would like to conduct my business.Please take a patients allergies seriously when the CLEARLY SPELL THEM OUT FOR YOU.  MEDshape is a misleading name as it would lead clients to believe that you have some medical experience. You pushed a weight loss powder on me that contained an allergen that sent me to the ER with a severe allergic reaction requiring hospitalization. No, I didn\\'t look closely at the ingredients because you are a medical facility which I assumed after paying you a significant amount of money would NEVER give me something I was allergic to. Not only should you pay for my hospital stay but at the very least should refund the money I paid you for nothing.  Oh and have you ever heard of HIPPA?  \\nSeriously, calling another patients phone number because \"you didn\\'t believe we weren\\'t the same patient\" \" because our names and DOB were so similar?\" Absolutely unbelievable incompetence! \\nYelp doesn\\'t let you give zero stars, more important that others are made aware.Every thing is filthy nobody else here trash everywhere. I had to wait for service until they got off their cell phone. I for sure will not be coming backHorrible place. Young kids who play around, don\\'t listen, continually messing up on orders then give you attitude.  The manager on duty...despite her age...as playful with much colorful language and allows her employees to carry on. Playing in the back while we wait for someone to bless us with their presence to take our order. Lobby is always full of kids loitering around and often staff are hanging out with them. Facility has always been dirty, tables never wipe all (all of them had to leave because no clean table) very questionable activity outside at the parking lot with employees and customers. We stop going and will not return. Go to Another taco bell most of the rest doesn\\'t have this problem.Went here the other night with a few friends, it was rather busy so we gave them some time, but after 20 minutes of waiting we asked aboit our hookah only to find it was given away, so after shooting pool for 30 minutes we left, they actually had the audacity to charge us for that evem after their shitty serviceI try so hard with this place. Their dresses are absolute beautiful when needing one for a formal event. I\\'ve rented my christmas party dress here twice so far. I had an excellent experience with one of the workers there I forgot her name but she must of been off the day I picked my dress up. The girls in this store have the worst attitude and seem like they\\'re bothered when you ask for their assistance. Both years renting dresses and picking them up I was treated poorly. Not sure if there\\'s a training issue there but their customer service is AWFUL. The girl forgot to give me the UPS label for my dress (mind you I told her I would be out of town and needed it) she swore it was there but it wasn\\'t, therefore resulting in me getting a late fee for apparently not returning their dress in time. Be careful when dealing with the girls that work here and their funky attitudes.This gym is filled with old equipment that is so beat up and outdated it becomes dangerous to use. The weight room is an absolute disaster with no free space, largely due to the fact that there are tons of leg machines that do the exact same exercise (which happen to be 30 years old) cluttering up all the free space. The circuit machines are nice, but often crowded with one-to-one\\'s AARP members, which constitute most of the clientele at this gym. Though the gym brags about their \"new\" spin studio, they leave it locked whenever there isn\\'t a class taking place. If the gym would drop some of their old equipment, and free up some more free space in the cramped building, it would go a long way towards improving the overall performance of the gym. Absolutely not worth the $40 a month to be a member, they should only be asking their members a max of $10 a month for the quality of experience you get. All tv\\'s are shared with no audio hook ups at the gym, leaving most people reading the closed captions on HGTV during their workout. Terrible clientele with poor gym etiquette. Only reason I go here is because there is nothing else workable in the area.I should have listened to all of the horror stories about cancelled and delayed flights with allegiant air.  I have been waiting at the airport in Las Vegas since 10am for a 12pm flight...its almost 4pm and still waiting.  Apparently the plane needs a tire change.  the worst part is they have all of our luggage sitting on the tarmac beside the plane....almost 6 hours and counting....and its 110 degrees outside!  worst customer service EVER....oh yeah.....they gave us an $8 meal voucher. ...thanks for nothing allegiant!  Never again,I was seen here today by NP Rebecca Gonzales. She is unfriendly, uncaring and unprofessional. I felt like she was annoyed that I was there. She did not bother to hear/listen to me about my illness. She had her mind made up and that was it. I would avoid going to this location again if needed so that I would not have to be seen by her. \\n\\nThe rest of the staff was professional and friendly and the facility was clean.Recently changed owners again. No longer the Asian owner. I visited 2 weeks ago for a fairly large order. The owner was at the cash and open-mouthed coughed into the register and on his hands. He then proceeded to help the cook fill the order without gloves and without washing his dirty hands. The cook had dropped a wax paper hotdog wrap on the floor, the owner picked it up and returned it to the counter and sure enough, the cook used it. Gross! If you complain - you get \"the special\" - better to just warn others and never return.Burgers are okay. Fries are too thin, which means they tend to come out crunchy or cold or both. Shakes are decent. Service is slow and often inattentive.ZERO STARS ACTUALLY! Horrible!  Over priced, not the best menu and terrible service.  DON\\'T waste your money or time!Been here twice, the first time it was not bad. Had a huge group of 15 people and they gave us the VIP room.  It is very quiet for the AYCE Japanese as there was only 3-4 other table.  The Service is terrible here as the servers are very rude and likes to hide behind the counter and not come assist you.  The second time I went it was even worst that I will never come back.  First we had 10 people and it wasn\\'t even busy, we asked for the room and the server just ignored us.  So I asked another server and she gave me this ugly look and said in broken English \"No, not available.\" So we got stuck in the main room with another table.  The seating was so uncomfortable especially if you didn\\'t get the bench, the seating didn\\'t have back support and it was kind of small. I am not a big guy and it was bad, I don\\'t know how bigger people going to sit there.  \\n\\nSo at Osechi you write your own orders on paper but only 1/4 of your food actually came.  And the sashimi pieces keeps getting smaller and smaller - quality getting worst.  I asked for 25 piece of salmon sashimi only 10 came so I put in a few more orders.  By the 5th order all the servers saw us calling for them and all disappeared I can clearly see them peaking out.  This is before they spoke to the sushi bar (he might be the manager or owner) and told them most likely not to take any more orders from us; we did order a lot but we finished everything and was still hungry.  I got so sick of hunting these servers just to put a order in that only 1/4 came in so we just gave up and asked for dessert.  Only thing good is that the have black sesame ice cream, mango pudding and deep fried banana.  \\n\\nI would not return for such lousy service and okay food quality with so much competition for AYCE sushi out there for around the same price.  I wouldn\\'t be surprise if this place be gone within the end of the year as well as this location keep changing every time I go to this plaza.\\n\\nRating:\\n\\nService: 1/5\\nFood Quality: 3/5\\nComfort 2/5\\nDecor  3/5\\nValue: 3/5\\nParking: 5/5This happened yesterday, Thursday October 22nd 2015. My sister made a reservation for 8pm. My aunts and my cousin arrived at 7:55pm. The hostess, a petite young woman in a black pencil skirt and a lacy cropped tank top told them, \"We\\'re just waiting for a table to clear.\" There was a table nearby and no one was sitting there. It just hasn\\'t been cleared or wiped yet. A few moments later, I arrive. My aunts tell me to ask the hostess what\\'s going on. I approach her and she tells me, \"We\\'re just waiting for someone to clear the table.\" Two men arrive at the table and clear it. My sister arrives and we all sit in the waiting area, waiting to be seated. At this point, the table still hasn\\'t been wiped and we haven\\'t been seated. I look at my watch and its 8:14pm. What\\'s the point of having a reservation if it\\'s not going to be honored at its scheduled time? We approach the hostess and tell her we\\'re leaving because we have been kept waiting too long. The hostess stares blankly and looks at the desk. She doesn\\'t apologize. We\\'re all pretty unimpressed by her behavior and leave.\\n\\nI have worked in the food service industry for 14 years. Perhaps the hostess was having a bad day, is new or maybe she just didn\\'t care. She\\'s human, she\\'s allowed to have weaknesses but then I beg the question, is that the kind of employee you want representing your restaurant? Your restaurant lost a bill for 5 people yesterday and I will tell everyone I know about my experience. Maybe that will inspire your employee to be a bit more empathetic and helpful to the next customers she serves. I hope no one else receives the lack of service we did last night.Walked into this place with my 10 year old daughter. She picked up a ring to try it on and show me. An employee walked by and said \\'those are not toys.\\' Wow lady!! We walked right back out and will never be back!Really slow. Came in morning and only one teller, line was too long so came back in afternoon amd still only one teller. Might as well shut this one down. No merchant window and a merchant went berserk, and almost got kicked out.This is right next to my apartment but it\\'s just not worth going to. There\\'s not a great selection of alcohol and the food is over priced. It also takes forever to figure out where you\\'re going to sit... theres just so much potential but I feel that since they opened they haven\\'t been able to figure out how to work....I waited in line for 45 minutes to get my car. I then had to wait 45 more minutes while they \"washed\" my car. \\n\\nCar rentals are new experience for me. I didn\\'t realize how big of a deal it is to take a car from one location and drop it off at another. I\\'m upset that this wasn\\'t  clearly stated especially for somebody that has no experience renting cars. They should take a little more time with that person just to make things clear. It ended up costing me almost double what I was supposed to pay to drop the car off at a different airport. That\\'s what you get for going cheap so next time I\\'ll pay a little bit more and hope for a better experience.Second time back after they messed up our order last week.  Guess what? They messed up our order AGAIN! \\n\\nDon\\'t even bother going on a Saturday morning at 9:30-10:30, the line was out the door with an poorly trained kid accepting patrons at only one POS terminal (they have three), people were waiting over 10 minutes just to place their order.  Watched a woman yell at the staff because she\\'s been waiting 15 minutes for a \"warmed up\" coffee cake.  We have gift cards that we bought at Costco since we\\'ve LOVED Einstein Bros out of Vegas, I threw them in the trash; I\\'ll never go back. Permanent Fargo Embargo.A \"90 minute\" timeshare presentation took upwards of six hours. Totally ruined our vacation. Then at the end they tried to give us different gifts than we were promised.I\\'ve been going to this place for so long I have well over 7 sessions on my arms and I see no difference at all I feel like my hair is growing back thicker ... I don\\'t even think it\\'s changed since I\\'ve started the first time. I shaved a week ago and this is my hair today after more than 7 sessions and over 1000$ later i look like this ! .. don\\'t think I\\'ll be going back anymore waste of money for sureThis dump does not even deserve 1 star! I was looking forward to my second visit to Chipotle in my life and it happened to appear like a message from God after a long walk on the strip. The workers on the \"burrito\" line were great...except for the last two. One girl wrapped up your burrito in foil and the other wrote on them and prepared them for the cashier. The girl wrapping the burritos seemed like a robot and therefore didn\\'t notice that every piece of pre-cut foil was a little too small to wrap the full burrito. This left a small 1/2 inch by 2 inch exposed area on the burrito. That\\'s OK (I thought) as she finished wrapping, but then the retard flipped the burritio upside down and the next employee in line just slid the burrito down the counter to the cashier! SOOOO GROSS. You could tell they had a \"rhythm\" going as it was busy (as I\\'m sure it always is since it\\'s on the strip). So once I told her there was no way in hell i was eating a burrito that had been slid on a counter all the way to the cashier, she seemed upset but ordered another burrito to be made right away. Then, I get to the cashier and order myself a Corona with my burrito. Corona pops on the counter but with a disgusting lime. It wasn\\'t even a faint shade of green, it was brown and way squishy. Almost the consistency of playdoh. I\\'m not about to drink herpes in a bottle so I explained that the lime was near compost quality and the same lady that I complained about the burrito to went fishing in the lime bin. She came out with another lime that had a brown bruise on the skin and said \"They all look like that\" and I took it, because I am well aware of the bruising habits of limes in particular since Coronas are like water in my life. I could have debated on the difference between the first lime I received and the second, but I was hungry and really needed to start chugging the beer after my experience. Sorry for the INCONVENIENCE CHIPOTLE. I surely slowed down your process on that nice Saturday afternoon on the strip but why don\\'t you serve SANITARY food. As far as I\\'m concerned, you should be shut down for health violations, but I am sure you won\\'t be because most of the people ingesting your food are drunk and/or nasty and probably already have HIV.We eat here all the time, but will not be returning.\\n\\nEven before my sister found a cockroach in her iced tea, they waiter nitpicked our every requests. Requested a pickle for my niece to keep her entertained while we were waiting to order, he wouldn\\'t bring it until we ordered. Acted as if we were trying to scam free things out of them. When my mother asked for sour cream and apple sauce for her side item potato pancake he tried to charge us for both. Only after my mother went to pay did they discount the meal. And the waiter did not even apologize for being rude.  So disappointed.Food was absurdly bad. Service was even worse. Definitely never coming back. Do not recommend one bit.We were looking forward to a real deli on the west side of Las Vegas.  However, we were disappointed.  I would think that when a restaurant opens it would put it\\'s best foot forward.  This place stumbled.\\nFour of us recently came to Canter\\'s for dinner.  We ordered the potato knish.  When it was finally delivered to the table it resembled the frozen knishes you could find at Smith\\'s Supermarket-not a real knish.  What was worse, it had been cooked (or fried) so long that it was as hard as a rock and we had to send it back.  We ordered a brisket sandwich.  One of the things that sets brisket apart is that it is juicy and moist and cooked slowly for a long time.  The brisket we received was so dried out that it was almost inedible.  We ordered a corned beef sandwich.  Corn been, regular or lean, should also be juicy and moist.  The corned beef we received was so dry it stuck to your tongue. We received the sandwiches 40 minutes after we ordered them.  The restaurant was almost empty at the time so a delay was unacceptable.  We never received pickles or the cole slaw which should come with the sandwiches.  We asked for a manager to explain the situation with the hope that positive criticism would help the place.  No one was around who we could talk with.  We left almost all of the food, paid, and went some place else for dinner.\\nI would think a new restaurant would pay attention to detail, have a prepared kitchen staff who knew hoe to cook the food, and provide at least a modicum of service.\\nGreat expectations dashed!From what everyone\\'s said, I would have to imagine that the store (if you live in Cleveland) is amazing. If you can walk in there and buy something, more power to you. HOWEVER, if you are an internet shopper, try again. I placed a very large order only to get absolutely no response, not even a simple cancellation. They haven\\'t charged me, but they also will not answer my email (and I\\'ve tried 4 different bent crayon email addresses) nor even answer the phone. Their answering machine is even full! Their online inventory lead me to believe they were the greatest store ever...but really...how hard is it to just write me back and say \"Sorry, we don\\'t have anything in that order of yours.\" Oh, and it\\'s been about a month and a half.My car was picked up from my home in Houston on Memorial Day, May 28, with an ETA in Minneapolis of June 11.  The car sat in Houston for a week and was then taken to Mesquite, where it sat for a week.  It then made it as far as Markham, IL. I was assured on a daily basis by \"customer service\" that is would be loaded that night.  It FINALLY left Markham (8 hours away) on June 17 and arrived in Minneapolis on the 18th.  I had paid to have it delivered but opted to pick it up because it wouldn\\'t have been delivered till the next day!  I understand that the ETA is only an estimate, but they went 50% over the estimate and lied to me over and over.  I would have appreciated an honest answer.TERRIBLE ETHICS AND CHEATERS! \\n\\nCelebrating with my extended family, 2 elders birthday.

Peking Duck - 1/4 of the plate was actually just skin and we never got remaining Peking Duck as a dish on the side. \\n2. Fish stew - SO SALTY! I took one spoonful and I almost spit it back out. I had to wash it down with tea to get rid of the immense amount of salt in my mouth.\\n3. Crispy Chinese Roast Pork with BBQ pork - Can\\'t go wrong with this.\\n4. Tofu mix with baby mussels - I didn\\'t even bother eating this as I can make this at home anyday and it\\'ll probably cost me less half of what they charged us. \\n5. Mushroom cooked with beef bites - Nothing special and I can make it for less than half of what they charged us.\\n6. Cabbage wrap - Tasted good but we were only provided with 10 cabbage wraps when we had 14 guests and there were clearly more than enough fillings. Why is the restaurant cheating us on cabbages?\\n7. Big lobster cooked with soya sauce - Big as in 5 lbs? This is probably the most expensive dish on the menu and it was overcooked.\\n8. Stirred fried chinese vegetables (tong choi) with fermented tofu - Again, I can make this for less than what they charged us.\\n9. Chinese Birthday Buns - Tasted like every other restaurant. Nothing special.\\n\\nOur family, whom were in the restaurant business clearly can tell that we got cheated for the dishes served.\\n1. This is a birthday celebration, why are we serving such simple dishes? If we want this we could\\'ve just stayed in and make it ourselves. \\n2. Where are the rice/noodle dishes? According to the parents AND the server it\\'s a norm to include a rice/noodle (carbs) dish for set menus. Guests can request for additional white rice if required. \\n3. The portion provided were not even big enough. Everyone barely had a spoonful of each dish. \\n\\nMANAGER who recommended us this menu - We expect you to use your experience and expertise to provide us with reasonable recommendations as it is your job to ensure we enjoy our time and meal at the restaurant. CLEARLY you only care about profit and not retaining customers cause you just lost your restaurant more than a dozen potential customers. \\n\\nSERVERS - You were very attentive but clearly not enough of you as we struggle to get your attention or other tables are trying to steal your attention away from us when we were clearly talking to you.\\n\\nNo ethics or professionalism in customer service and dishes weren\\'t even close to a good enough standard or portion to the amount that we paid. \\n\\nP.S. Tips weren\\'t even included as part of the bill. We still paid 10% out of courtesy as the servers were doing their job but we honestly didn\\'t want to pay as the manager was just a pain and didn\\'t apologize for what happened.\\n\\nNEVER RETURNING!!!!I would not recommend flowers by Renee. I called to have some flowers delivered to my 7 year old niece who was at home recovering from a very traumatic experience and I was told they would be delivered this afternoon.  It\\'s 4:50pm and I just got off the phone with them and I was told \"they are going out next\".  I was also told that \"if you wanted them there by a certain time I needed to be clear and make arrangements for that.\" I had explained the whole traumatic experience to the girl who took my order so I thought it was pretty clear that the sooner the better. I guess it\\'s all business to some people. There was no apology, no making up for it.  I picked this florist because they were 1.75 miles from my sister\\'s house and with paying the $10 delivery fee I thought they would get there in the afternoon as I was told. The minimum order is $35 and then you add on the $10 delivery....I would expect some customer service and polite people for that.  I hope the flowers are pretty.  If they\\'re not decent I will be sure to add another review.  I\\'m giving this a one star with giving them the benefit of the doubt that the flowers will be nice.  I won\\'t use them again either way!Incredibly salty! Ordered the Sesame Beef Udon Noodle Stir-fry... Will never come back again. A complete waste of money as it was inedible. Very pricey too.So, after our poor experience with Wedge early on, my wife and I decided to give them another try for brunch.  BIG MISTAKE.  First off, and most importantly, I got food poisoning -- possible culprits were their guacamole that had a faintly moldy taste to it, the chips that were stale, and the mushy rice that seemed like it had been sitting in a steam table all day.\\n\\nEven if you don\\'t buy the food poisoning issue, the food was just awful.  Crushed, canned pineapple on the (moldy) guacamole; mushy, gross rice with obviously pre-frozen vegetable medley folded into it; lukewarm coffee.  I didn\\'t even get asked how I wanted my eggs on my huevos rancheros, and they came out over-hard (blech).  The tortillas (like the chips) were stale.  \\n\\nThe service was terrible as well, complementing their awful food.  Our waitress only brought one of us a water (odd choice), asked for our drink order and walked away after only ONE of us answered, tripped and sloshed my lukewarm coffee all over the mug and saucer, and rather than cleaning it up, simply set it down, asked if I wanted a napkin, and never returned with one -- leaving me with a mug covered in coffee.  We had to ask for silverware after our food was delivered.  Meanwhile, the other server was shouting across the patio to (who I guess was) the manager on duty for information as to what various items on the menu were.  \\n\\nGiven there is better Mexican AND brunch options within walking distance of this place, I can\\'t imagine why ANYONE would go here.I\\'ve been to this location numerous times just because it\\'s so convenient, but I don\\'t plan on returning. The quality at this location is awful. We ordered chips and queso and the chips were terribly stale. When we asked for new chips, the employee turned to her colleague and asked for new chips to be made as \"the chips have been stale all day.\" Not too sure if she knew we heard her, but if you knew the chips were stale, why would you knowingly continue to serve them to your patrons!?! I can only assume they could care less about the quality of their product and their employees take zero pride in their workplace. Such a shame. This location is an embarrassment. I\\'ll be driving farther from now on to go to a Cafe Rio that cares about who and what they serve.I love smash burger in general but this location is bad. Slow and bad customer serviceI called the hotel at 6:29 to tell them I needed pickup from the airport and was told it would be 20-30 minutes. After 45 minutes I call the hotel again and am told it will be 5 more minutes. Finally at 7:26 the van pulls up. Three more minutes and it would be an hour that I waited for the shuttle. The driver is rude and we continue to sit at the airport and wait 15 more minutes. By the time I get to the hotel I have been in pit for nearly two hours, severely cutting into an already limited rest period which is slightly crucial for the people working your flights. Horrible customer service and a waste of time.Waited several minutes for the hostess to show up at the podium to seat us. Once she showed up, she had an attitude!  We told her we\\'d like a booth for 2. She said, \"fine it\\'ll be 5 minutes.\"  I\\'m said REALLY!! The place was nearly empty!! We told her we\\'ll go somewhere else. She again \"fine \". That young lady just cost the server and the company money!!!First time there... Christopher\\'s big cherry was apparently opened (found out later at home).... Claeys fudge was the worst fudge ever (pitched).... my wife bought the bulk taffy, and it was as old as the hills... On our way out I saw the owner and wanted my two boys to meet the guy since I see his picture on the ads... He walked right by us without saying a word. Looked very grumpy. Won\\'t be going back.All in few words .\\nNot clean , hallways ; carpets.  Besides not sure about how managment handles asigning rooms. Two nights in a row there were like 50 kids plus  parents . Kids running all over places and parent drinking beer on the hallway and all with deaf problems because they were yelling not talking until 3 am  . Anyhow we called the front  desk  and they didn\\'t care.  \\nAnyhow an advise for everyone.. ask before they give you a room so you won\\'t be having a terrible nigh.About two hours after the Pepsi was delivered I got a call from the young woman who took my order and then was disturbed because I raised my voice.  She did not apologize for her poor judgment and attitude.  She told me she was going to give me a \"full credit\" for the $30.00 of food I had ordered. I told her since I had paid cash that would be difficult. She said she would see to it I got a full refund.  It was neither delivered to my door nor to the motel where I am staying.  So, not only are they inefficient, she\\'s a liar.Checked in through their website for a haircut while on a layover.  Got a text saying to be at the shop in 6 minutes.  Rushed over from my hotel and when I got there was told it would be at least 30 more minutes.  Was also told that the check-in system doesn\\'t give accurate times.\\n\\nThe chairs in the shop were all empty and there were 3 girls standing around when I was told this...\\n\\nWasted my time and didn\\'t get a haircut.\\n\\nNext time, I\\'ll go somewhere else.Horrible airport burrito I ever had. The shop looks nice with catchy phrases like 360 gourmet ingredients and what not but the taste is awful. Even worse, they charge you extra for everything, right from cheese, sauce, and guac. An usual burrito with all the usual ingredients will make it to $20 here. Such a daytime robbery for a tasteless burrito. Grab a flatbread at the Einstein bagels right across and you will be happy you did that.Terrible!  We have been going to Peachtree since it opened.  It was always great food and good atmosphere, But something has changed.  The food was bland and well, just bland. The deviled egg app used to be fabulous and now tastes like prepacked Sysco food.  And the clientele is now loud drunks that camp out all evening and ruin a nice place.  Small restaurants should decide if they are a bar or a foodie place.  Peachtree is now a bad mix of both.  I will no longer recommend it.  Too bad.I think the convention centre payed for those 5 star reviews. Yes, the atmosphere was good, the DJ did his job well but the food. The food was a sad excuse for microwavable Italian food. I could have gotten better food in the frozen food isle at metro.The WORST!\\nFirst of all let me say I felt like I read every possible article I could find of the best buffets in Vegas because I was so excited to try a Las Vegas buffet. I am not a \"buffet\" person so I wanted to make sure that I made the right decision for the ONE time I was actually excited to go to one. Ugh, I couldn\\'t have been more disappointed. From the moment we walked in all my expectations were crushed. First of all, the buffet hall (yes it\\'s a hall) smelled weird. I couldn\\'t place it but it just must have been all of the food smells mixing together and it was not appetizing. The crab lags were cold and I mean FREEZING. But if you happened to see someone else do it (because here wasn\\'t a sign) you could take them to the Taco station to have them heated (?) But even then they were average. And that was the problem across the board, everything was just average. Tacos had very little flavor, every pasta was a greasy creamed based mess, the jumbo shrimp were average size and not jumbo at all. I read about the pesto mashed potatoes, but they were a let down too. At the end of the day I felt like a was at a Golden Corral and not the Bellagio. I read some of the bad reviews before we went and thought that those people were just being dramatic and it couldn\\'t possibly be as bad as they wrote and I was wrong. I will never go back.One man show with a guy who is arrogant, does not listen to the customer and has incompetent staff. We went through hell with Michael Aldridge and his less than qualified rude staff. Like Mary H., I was previously in the business and have no Idea how this pompous fellow remains in business. Stay clear, find a true professional.I came here at 9pm and the sign on the door said they were closing at 10pm. The door was locked and the people in the restaurant were cleaning up. I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume the sign on the door was wrong so I knocked several times and pointed to it. For ten minutes. They aggressively avoided eye contact with me and looked at each other, laughing and chuckling. As if I\\'m the crazy one for knocking on the door when they should be open according to the sign they put out on their door.\\n\\nIf you want bad service from all around incompetent and rude people, Bacus Bros is the place for you.Went in last week to get a simple DVD player installed (to replace a broken one) before a long car trip. The employee (can\\'t remember his name) said to buy one online then come back and they could easily install it for $40 and would only take about 30 min. He was very nice and helpful.\\nMy husband came in to get the DVD player installed today. He talked to R and was told he didn\\'t have time to install it anytime soon (even though no one was there). R also told him it would be $80. R acted like he didn\\'t even want to try to help my husband schedule an appointment.\\nMy husband called the scottsdale location and they told him they could get him right in and install. It was only $49. They were much more friendly and helpful. We wont be going back to this location!!Currently at the airport awaiting my flight....went over to this restaurant because my flight is at D8. The waitress is the nastiest/tidiest individual I have ever met in my life. We politely asked the male waiter if we can seat ourselves and he said yes. We sat down and the waitress saw us and said she\\'d be over soon. We grabbed menus from the table next to us because we only had 30 min before boarding. The waitress throws menus on our table and says with a nasty aggressive attitude \"patience is a virtue\"....so rude. Excuse me??? We got up and left. Don\\'t waste your time here it will only aggravate your tripRule #1 in this article applies to me and why I will never return to this studio (see bottom of post). I was trying to heal from a back injury, but wanting to do Bikram yoga again, I bought a temporary pass at this studio to see how I would do. I wanted to take it easy so as not to reinjure my back. After all, It took me over a year to heal. I explained, disclosed that I would go at my own pace and that I may not do some of the forms. They acknowledged my request and I reminded the instructors of it each time I took a class. However, to my disappointment, on two separate occasions and with two different instructors, I was singled out in class. In these two different classes, my instructors wanted to show me proper form and then proceeded to instruct me to do an aggressive (for me at the time) posture of which I was not ready for. I exclaimed that it hurt too much and they still proceeded to instruct me! Feeling embarrassed and pressured, I tried it. Now, I am back to seeing my neuro doctor and starting from square one. Perhaps the studio instructors could learn a bit by taking a dose of instruction themselves. It is our own practice after all and don\\'t let them tell you otherwise. Please see the link below: \\n\\nhttp://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-13781/5-things-i-wish-people-would-start-doing-in-bikram-yoga.htmli just had the worst meal i\\'ve ever  had, in my 60 years of dining out. I have come to this place frequently and always had great mexican food but last night i couldnt even finish one of the fish tacos.\\n\\nthey forgot to put on the sauce so it was dry. everyting from the beans to the rice to the fish were WAY over salted. the margaritas tasted like water even tho happy hour was over.\\n\\nthe staff pretends they dont understand you when you try to complain. they said they would give me my meal for free: which is what the coupon we had was anyway. and they still charged us for the awful drinks and the overly salted sides.\\nits too much work to complain so we just paid and left.\\n\\nThis used to be the best mexcian food in town; now with all the new competition opening in the area, they need to stay on top of things.\\n\\nI see it closing in the near future....cant imagine anyone returning to this place.\\nVery sad.....The only redeemable thing about this place was the good food. However, our server never returned after Taking our order. We were never given napkins or silverware. We asked for napkins from a busser & 15 min later still didn\\'t have any. I had to get up to get them from the back myself. Never got a refill on drinks or got check. We were done for 20 min and no one approached us. Started getting harassed by a drunk group by fire pit over taking our extra chair we were using for our purses. Kept arguing about how a persons isnt sitting there. We gave in & moved our things. This group was falling out of their chairs and burning MENUS yet the business kept serving them MORE alcohol. Finally threatened to throw them out if they burned another menu. Which they did. But restaurant didn\\'t cut them off or throw them out. Just came back & scolded them. Finally got fed up with waiting & getting harassed so I got up to ask for the check. I was so pissed we spoke to a manager about our server disappearing and the obviously drunk group outside. Manager apologized once and that was it. Didn\\'t invite us back or wish us a good night. Poor customer service from top down. I guess if you\\'re not an obnoxious drunkard, you won\\'t enjoy yourself.Terrible service. Although the food was okay, one of the servers, Christine, was racist. When the table next to us informed her that we were calling her, she made an annoyed expression, ignored us, and our order was never taken care of. She sat next to and talked with other male customers. I\\'ve never seen such a brazen-faced and rude worker. The management here is horrible.This is nothing to compare with real Serbian food. The service is beyond terrible, the food is as well terrible. For there shopska salad, they use the cheapest roma tomatoes, and while you pay $5.50 for a plate, you have about 3 soup spoons of salad, seriously??!!\\nThe chevape who ever says are out of this world or best in there life, those people probably never ever tried authentic chevape!! They have no taste, they were over cocked, they did not even smell on chevape. Same as the pljeskavica... Tasteless rubbery ground meat. Veshalica was acceptable but again not even close to how should be. Big plater with meat for at least 3 people to eat but fries for one person...what s joke.\\nNobody cares if u enter it or not, very unwelcome atmosphere, very dark, have to use phone light to read the menu. \\nService was unbelievable terrible, the owner was there but he dose not care for customers, the only thing this person cares is to put money in his pocket. \\nWe asked for bread 3 times and ketchup as well... On the end waitress asks if everything was OK???! Seriously???\\nDon\\'t waste your money.., and it\\'s a lot of money as this place is very very OVERPRICED !!!!\\'I was in Vegas last week with three of my friends. We purchased a Groupon deal for a 20 minute foot detox and 70 minute massage. This was one of the worst massage experiences I\\'ve ever had. The employees were rude and scammed us out of our money. We paid $38 for the Groupon and the fine print didn\\'t state any additional charges. When we arrived we were told we had to pay a $10 per person facility fee. We quickly argued this fee since it did not state it on the Groupon. Quickly the guy changed his story and said it was the sales tax on the full service amount which was $100. Well to get technical, if it was a legitimate sales tax it would have been around $8 instead of $10. But again the Groupon didn\\'t state anything about any additional fees. We ended up paying the fee just to get on with the day and get the service going. They made us fill out a form stating how we would like our massages and any spots we do not want massaged. I had stated I did not want my feet massaged because I don\\'t like people touching my feet. Just before the service started, the front desk guy came in and told he that if I did not want my feet massaged it would cost me an additional $35. Yes, you read that correctly. They wanted me to pay more for less service. Then I started to question, why did they even ask if I didn\\'t want a certain part massaged at all? The massage was not great at all. The guy I had was really rude and unpleasant. The way he was massaging me made me think that maybe he wasn\\'t certified. \\n\\nI didn\\'t want to tip the guy at all, but we were quickly told that tipping was mandatory with a $10 minimum.... Yes, another $10 on top of the \"facility fee\".  This is a horrible establishment and people should go elsewhere. Last time I was in Vegas I got a massage at a place called Reflective Hands and they did a great job. I would\\'ve gone there this time but they weren\\'t able to accommodate my entire party at the same time.  \\n\\nThink twice before buying this Groupon... HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE...Be careful here. You don\\'t have any rights due to this being a Indian casino. This place took my mom winning away from her. My mom went to dinner there with a girl friend and after went and played a slot. After about 30 minutes of play a casino employee came over and asked for her ID. Once the employee had her ID he told her that she needed to come with him. After ask him why several times he finally answered. They said some lady had money in the machine my mom was playing. Witch I don\\'t get why if someone had money in a machine why would you walk away from it? My mom put $40 in and after 30 minutes got it up to $200. Once they got into some room they took her to. They gave her two options witch were give the money back, or they would arrest her. My mom has never been in trouble and was very scared. This place must be going broke if they need to scare little old lady\\'s and take them in a mafia style back room and press her to give the money she won far and square. Shame on you. If you want to go to a place that will make u give back the money you won and were you have no rights then go to this casino.I called at 10 a.m. to find out when someone was coming as my warranty company had set up an appt for the following day between 8 a.m. and 12 noon. Well, the rude woman on the phone promptly told me that they didn\\'t go by their orders and could not have anyone out until Monday...............6 day more with leaking water from my 4 mo. old Maytag refrigerator?  I don\\'t think so, further she asked for a credit card for $75 service fee if it was not an item covered by my warranty which I refused to give, so she refused to set up any appts.  I had to call the Maytag warranty company back and set up another appt with Brownie\\'s who immediately came!!wow....how can it go from so consistent to so BAD!\\nJust returned from a month long trip and needed this shaggy head trimmed. I get the same cut every time, however, like most of these places, I got a different stylist. \\nEverything was going fine and she was pleasant and nice. But when she turned me to face the mirror, damn! The front of my hair looked fine but the back part of my head looked like a little kid had gotten a hold of some scissors and simply cut a large swath of hair randomly off the top of my head! She basically made my hair look like I live in a wood shack in the Appalachian mountains.\\nBut you can\\'t fix it. I mean, I would have to buzz cut the whole thing! When I came home my wife said \"what the hell?\" and then my in laws snickered.The place is over priced ... Drinks were bad dint even deserve one star the hookah was try badddd and they charged us twice .....\". Cant remember servers name sorry and i did not let manager know about food issues. I dont like to send food back to the kitchen. I have heard about to many bad experiences when people send food back. It seems crazy that i should have had any issues like this from a Hard Rock Cafe. I appreciate your quick reply and i hope the cooks in the kitchen learn to check the food before sending it out. That is restaurant 101.This is my first review. I love Yelp and have used the reviews for over a year now, but now I am obligated to write my first review because the poor service I keep receiving at Oregano\\'s.  I have been a customer of this establishment for over 10 years, and have been receiving poor service from every location.  It\\'s too bad that the service is so bad, because this place has the potential of being one of the best in town. The poor service and poor managing is a reflection of the ownership.  I know I am not the only one who feels this way.  Mr. Mark please, please, please change your ways, or retire so we can enjoy the great food that keeps you in busness.We had a group of 5 it took 1 hr for us to be seated we asked why so long and their response was it\\'s hard to get a table for 5 ready.  Finally 55 minutes later we get seated then we encounter the rudest  waitress ever, she was short with us, kept forgetting the sweetener for the tea, when we gave her our order she kept correcting us of how to say it was sharp n rolled her eyes at us. So we get our meal n the mash potatoes were cold, our meal was served piece meal we ordered shrooms with our steak n they came way later we kept asking for our shrooms and she said oh they are being heated...bad bad service several of our friends experieced bad service so they have not been back n neither will I.First off I\\'m only giving one stars because I love their food but otherwise it wouldn\\'t even be one.\\nWe were a large party of 25 that I called in the morning to set up.  When we got there the restaurant was pretty much empty.  It was my daughters baptism so I had family in from other parts of town too we were trying to enjoy with.\\nEverything was slow from the beginning drinks alcohol bread.  It took forever for us to even get our order in and we told her from the beginning we wanted separate checks and who was on what check.  The waitress forgot drinks and food all night, seemed overwhelmed and actually gave one of my guests pizzas to another table so he sat waiting for over an hour wondering where it was and finally ordered French fries to hold him over until the pizza that was coming never came, he then canceled it after he realized she had no idea where or what happened.  The food came out here and there, one salad appetizer here, someone rises meal there, and the pizzas all took the longest.  We had basically ask her over an over for things and wait a long time for everything.  She apologized but after 2 half hours we decided to skip desert we just wanted to leave.  It then took like a half hour if not longer to figure out everyone\\'s separate checks (which we asked for in the beginning) almost every check she gave out was wrong.  The other girl that was there even apologized again for the long long wait.  I just wanted to enjoy the day of my daughters baptism with great food, with my family and relax.  It was not relaxing or enjoyable AT ALL everyone was annoyed and hungry.\\nWon\\'t be going back regardless of how tasty I think the food is, it\\'s not the first time I\\'ve had crappy slow service in there but this was the worst!!!Beware... Get a 90 min massage and then all of a sudden you are supposed to pay 15.00 tip. Sorry when did tips become mandatory?  at 50.00 10.00 is 20% why do they think they should get more? And if they do I have the right to decide that not them. Loved them for years now I am not returning. Plenty of places on Spring mountain to try for massages.Buyer beware -  I went to purchase flowers from the 70% off rack - the entire isle states 70% off, when it came time to check out, they were full price.  Clerk said that that specific color isn\\'t clearances out, but the rest were...... interesting they are located in the CLEARANCE aisle with a sign that says 70% off.  \\nI also bought material, regular priced material, bolt DID NOT INDICATE CLEARANCE on the material.  I wanted to use a coupon on the item, \" Sorry Ma\\'am, that material is on clearance.\"   No it\\'s full price, no where did it indicate it was on clearance.   Poor sales representation JoAnn Fabrics and Gifts.Very disappointed! I ordered egg benedict trio snd avocado was spoiled when other waiter came to clean i said this is how you serve food?? He said ok i will let your waiter know. He told our waitress she just walked away and sent the bill. I wanted her to apologize and let the kitchen manager know i did mot expect it removed it from the check 25$ wont make rich or poor. And overall restaurant waiters at Wynn and Encore are mean not professional at all! \\nWhoever orders check in-front of the waiter before eating!My roommate, little sister and I arrived at the Olive Garden, 1261 W Southern Ave, Mesa, AZ 85202 location, on 4/10 at 7:35pm and were seated around 7:40pm. As we sat for 15min waiting for our waiter to even acknowledge us, we heard the long table in the middle of the room with maybe 4 adults and 4-5 children start to complain about how long they had been waiting. There were scattered drinks and breadsticks along the table to they had SOME service already. As they sat there we heard their complaints get louder and louder accompanied by a few slammed fists on the table. When the waiter arrived with their soup and salad, one of the women at the table said they didn\\'t even want it anymore because they had ordered 20min ago and they were \"over it\". They then demanded to speak to a manager. Less than 60 seconds later, a blonde manager comes to the table to address the situation. She is then pulled aside by a different lady sitting at the table wearing a very fitting pink \"Birthday Diva\" sash. The manager and the Birthday Diva talked tucked in a corner for around 10-15 min (mind you, at this point we have only just put in our appetizer and drink order and it had yet to come). When the manager and Birthday Diva arrived back at the table, the manager declared how bad she felt about the whole situation and that she would be comping the entire table\\'s meal. At this time the table continued to complain about anything and everything they could think of as a swarm of waiters came to clear the dirty plates and dishes from their table to make them \"more comfortable\". As this is happening, we hear the guests at the table continue to add things to the bill, have the food that was finally brought out boxed up to go, AND ON TOP OF THAT the staff came out and sang happy birthday! I felt terrible for the waiters and the expressions on their faces made it obvious they were feeling sorry for themselves as well. It\\'s about 8PM now and we have barely been served our appetizer with drinks following another 10min after and our salad/soup/breadsticks and dipping sauce an additional 10 min after that. During the next 15min before our food comes out, we see the middle table ordering around their crew of staff like puppet masters, getting even MORE stuff added and comped off the bill, and interrupting another birthday song sang at a table adjacent from them (who had been waiting EVEN LONGER with no complaints). The drama with the Birthday Diva completely consumed the room and every other table was exchanging looks with each other like \"is this really happening\" as we all sat with empty glasses with melted ice and puddles of condensation  watching the middle table get completely catered to all while being embarrassingly rude. The final straw for me, and the reason I took the time out of my day to write this, was when the blonde manager came out and handed a gift card to every single person at that table. I understand if I was one of the people at the table how happy and compensated I would feel at that point, but as a fellow guest sharing the same space having my service delayed, interrupted, inconsistent and neglected BECAUSE of them, made us feel like chopped liver! We could not believe what was happening and just wanted to get our to-go boxes and leave. We weren\\'t expecting our meals to be comped, but the manager never even approached our table to apologize for the evening\\'s events or anything. The waiter tried to pretend it wasn\\'t happening, but he was extremely stressed and frazzled the entire time because he was the original waiter for the middle table, which resulted in him being short with us and unintentionally rude. Some acknowledgement of our extreme patience is all we wanted. I could tell blonde manager was super sweet and genuinely felt bad (whatever sob story the Birthday Diva told her must have been a tear jerker) because she was bending over backwards to make the guests happy. However, in result of how it was handled everything that the middle table was complaining about ended up happening to us and EVERY OTHER TABLE IN THE ZONE. In conclusion we paid our $90 bill, but the events of that night remained with us throughout the entirety of our evening even after leaving the restaurant because we could not believe how things went down. \\nIn conclusion, I\\'m not writing this with attached demands in order to keep me returning to the establishment- that\\'s not how I roll. I wanted to let it be known that the staff last night had a text book simulation on what to do when one table wants to control the whole place, and they failed miserably. We left feeling like we should have taken our money elsewhere, and knowing that\\'s the last thing you want your guests to experience, I wanted to let you know why. You can contact me with any additional questions, but for now it\\'s safe to say we will not be coming backSo true World\\'s slowest Swiss Chalet. They orders are never correct or on time. small portions and overpriced. .. Then food some times looks like it\\'s been tossed around looks more like a jail meal and it\\'s even a insult for the jail food..We walked in at 10:40 and sat at a table right next to the bar. Waiters and waitresses walked past us repeatedly and we finally went up to the bar to get our drinks. At 11:02 I went back up to the bar to inquire about getting food and was told they stopped serving at 11 to which I replied to the bartender that we had been sitting at a table right across from her for 20 minutes. She called out somebody\\'s name and I told her not to worry about it cuz I was so pissed off with her attitude she also mentioned that they are not a 2 a.m. bar, and with her attitude I could see why. The owner or manager came over a few minutes later and offered to buy us a shot for our troubles. At first we said no but then we were like screw it. I doubt I will give this place a second chance as it was obvious the waiters and waitresses did not want to serve us. They did wait on a table directly behind us and quickly got them menus and served them. Just overall crappy service.I probably should have done my due diligence in July of 2016 before signing up for the Petsmart-Banfield \"Wellness\" Plan as they have thousands of online complaints.  https://www.consumeraffairs.com/pets/banfield.html, just on this one website.  Banfiled pushes this wellness plan hard as if you sign up for this plan, they automatically deduct from your bank account $35.95 monthly for among other things, UNLIMITED office visits.   Well as you may know, it can be expensive to have a pet seen at a veterinarian\\'s office, so I agreed as to have peace of mind in case my pet needed to be seen.  Flash forward one year to Friday July 14th. Jasmine, my dog that I found through a rescue organization 3 years ago, I could tell she was not feeling well for a couple of days and then started throwing up and experiencing diarrhea.  She had not been drinking water as usual so I feared she may also be dehydrated.  I took Jasmine over to our neighborhood Petsmart at Christown, where they host a Banfield Hospital at the rear of the store.  It was 4pm on Friday and they had no medical staff available.  I spoke with the store manager and he advised there was a staffing issue that day which left the hospital closed.  I asked him to find out if another Banfield close by could take a look at Jasmine as she needed to be seen urgently.  He called both the Deer Valley location and the Desert Ridge locations and both locations declined to see Jasmine as they were fully booked for the rest of the day.  Clearly, Banfield Hospital have oversold their Wellness plan as they cannot even see an animal with an urgent need.  The Unlimited office visits is a wonderful benefit of the plan but worthless if you have a sick pet and they refuse service.  I complained directly to Banfield via email and they returned a standard form letter letting me know they will not withdraw further payments from my account. Meanwhile, I have paid for this service and when my pet needed them the most, we were turned away.I have to be honest here... I went inside this place last week and it just seems like a disaster. \\n\\nI walked in around 6 PM or so and was looking to buy a vape pen.  \\nThe place seems like it had a ton of selection but the place is tiny. With two people in the store, I had a hard time negotiating around the store. \\n\\nI wanted to pick up a vape pen but didn\\'t know where to start. No one said hi to me when I walked in.  I could see that the woman behind the counter didn\\'t really seem like she knew what she was doing. She was on the phone with a guy on speaker phone and it seemed like he was guiding her around the store to show her where stuff was while a customer was waiting for her to find it. \\n\\n I was behind someone else and really didn\\'t feel like I was going to get any level of knowledge  out of this place so I just took off. I went online, researched and bought  a pen online that had good reviews.  I went to this place cause the amazing reviews on yelp and google but seems like the place where you need to know what you\\'re buying, and just pick it up..Absolutely horrendous. I decided to chose this place to order off GrubHub instead of Olive Garden. Bad decision. I ordered clam linguine, which comes with a side salad and your choice of bread & calamari. Where do I begin? The calamari was obviously from a frozen package. Super chewy and tasted like a fried peice of rubber. The clam linguine? PSA: Do not expect to find any cans of clams at your local supermarket. All of them have been used in this bowl of linguine. I would have prefered 3 peices of REAL clam instead of those huge portion of salted rubber on my bowl. Ontop of that, it was SMOTHERED in oil. (See pictures above). I ended up scrapping the clams off and using the marina sauce from the calamari in the pasta. The salad was the only edible part of this meal, and even then, I used my own ranch dressing instead of the oil grease that came with it. As I began eating the salad, I noticed this dried up black speck. Ended up being a fly......................................................................................................\\nDISGUSTING ! $30 down the drain! I hope I do not end up with food poising in the morning!\\nSTAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!Sucks!  I got screwed by this company several times.   First, a sales guy knocked on my door and made a whole list of promises that weren\\'t true.  I was being charged about $40 a month more than I was told.  He also told me that if I was unhappy that I could just cancel anytime.   Well, that was another lie.  When I tried to cancel, I was told I was in a 2 year contract and will be charged a huge bullshit fee.  \\nSo, I was with them for about year, paid more than I was told and have to pay $150 to cancel.  Just a crappy company.We went for a Saturday lunch to meet friend in town. Food was eh, nothing made my mouth water and we could have easily ate the same meal for half price off of the strip. The wait staff was terrible and couldn\\'t find us a high chair throughout the entire 2.5 hours we were there. We will not be returning.We were in the market for a new car seat for our toddler, and my husband had been doing a lot of research online to figure out what would suit our needs best. Sears ended up carrying the lowest price of the model we decided to purchase, so we headed to The Boulevard Mall location this weekend. Once we were downstairs at the baby section, we found the selection of car seats. We noted the price was not what they had advertised online. We located a friendly employee that stated she was not on the clock yet, but was still helpful to us, indicating that we could speak with someone upstairs about the price difference and that they\\'d bring the car seat up to us upon purchasing.\\n\\nMy husband got in the short line for customer service. The guest before him was rudely interrupted by another customer waving a purse and cutting in line to make a purchase. The clerk took care of the rude customer first, only apologizing for the wait to the guest in front of us after the rude customer was out of earshot (we can only assume that the rude customer was either a friend of the clerk or a fellow employee, but who knows). And once it was my husband\\'s turn, he explained the price difference between what he had seen online with the same model they had on the shelf downstairs. She stated that the sale price was online only, even though we could find no evidence of this, and that if we wanted that sale price we\\'d have to buy it online.\\n\\nSo my husband said he\\'d use his phone right then and there to buy it online, expecting to be able to pick up the same car seat at this location, but the employee told us that it doesn\\'t work that way. If we wanted the item right then and there, we\\'d have to pay full price. If we wanted the online sale price, we\\'d have to pay for it now, but we couldn\\'t pick up the item until a code was emailed to us, which would take two hours or so.\\n\\nWe found it ridiculous that they couldn\\'t price match their own website, especially when the website had no indication that it was an \"online only\" price. We also found it ridiculous that we\\'d have to wait hours after paying to receive a notification to be allowed to pick up the item that was already waiting right there on the shelf. \\n\\nSears really needs to get with the times. Rather than dealing with that mess in order to save a measly $15, we left for Walmart to buy our new car seat.The food and prices are great, but the service is horrendous and consistently so. We\\'ve gone here many times and the service is always bad. You get seated right away, but are out of luck if you need to ever need something. The waiters and waitresses constantly walk by, but they won\\'t make eye contact. I ordered some sushi rolls off the menu and never received them. It took 45 minutes after asking several waitresses. The waitress brought out more than I ordered and said I wouldn\\'t have to pay for it. When we got the bill she had charged us for the rolls I never asked for. We even asked several waitresses about the rolls and everyone seemed to have forgotten about them. After terrible, neglectful service every time we finally are giving up on going here ever again.Absolutely dismal. We should have been tipped off by being the only 2 people in the place for Friday lunch. The \"server\" was hanging out watching a portable tv. Spring rolls were soggy and almost completely cabbage, plus having an overall odd taste. Wontons were bland as wallpaper paste. The dumplings were ok, but nothing special. My partner ordered pho which just....never came. We waited. And waited. The server kept going back into the kitchen, and we\\'d think, \"ok maybe now?\" Nothing. Finally having had enough we just told this kid to forget it, we\\'d pay for what we had eaten. He seemed surprised and his was response was \"oh, there was a misunderstanding, I think it\\'s almost done\". Um, what misunderstanding? We were the only 2 people there. In the duration that we were there ONE person came in to pick up takeout. \\nIn short, don\\'t bother. There are MANY better options for Americanized Chinese in the area.Went there today and got the same order as last time and the peri peri rice and roasted veggies were old and rotten. The rice smelled like it had been going bad for a few days the vegetables were shrived and the smelled repugnant. I ate the chicken on its own and then called them to tell them what was wrong with my dinner. Turns out the worst thing isn\\'t their food, it is how they treat their customers. The lady I spoke with was so rude, did not even apologize, rushed me off the phone and told me to call back when the manager was there. What kind of a business that wants to retain people serves them rotten food then don\\'t have the decency to apologize? I do NOT recommend this place because I couldn\\'t guarantee you would get food that isn\\'t rotten.I\\'m sorry to have to do this, but the owner of this place is a jerk.  I got yelled at, for playing pinball in a way that has helped me play very well in pinball tournaments and leagues over the years, and not one time has anyone, including the owners of some very rare and valuable games, mentioned anything to me about abusing a machine.  But that wasn\\'t the case here at the Pinball Hall of Fame.  Instead, I was told (in a very confrontational way) that new Stern machines were all made of plastic, the flipper buttons (of course), the sides (huh?) and the legs (did he really just say that?!?) and that I better calm down or I would be asked to leave.  BULL$HIT.  He treated me like a moron--flat out lied to me thinking I must not know any better.  This was after he stood about 5 feet away from me with his arms crossed watching very disapprovingly as I would hit the side of an Avatar machine to keep the ball from exiting the right orbit and dropping into the right sling.  Watch just about any pinball video or tutorial and it\\'s pretty clear this is the sorta thing you have to do to control the ball and continue playing.  It also does absolutely nothing to harm the game, and hitting the side with a sledgehammer certainly wouldn\\'t have caused a pop bumper to be non-functional, or the one-way gate at the top of the left orbit to be jammed up, as they were on this particular machine.  It also wouldn\\'t have caused AC/DC to be about 5 degrees off level.  And to make matters worse, I never encountered a tilt warning on AC/DC, Avatar, or the one EM I played before I was warned for a second time for making a very light slap save.\\n\\nI would think that Mr. Tim Arnold, of such long standing participation in the world of pinball operation, maintenance and collecting would know how to set a tilt bob to prevent players from being able to move the game in the slightest, since that\\'s apparently what he wants. I can now only assume that\\'s much too difficult a task, and it doesn\\'t give him an opportunity to eject people that obviously know what the hell they\\'re doing on a pinball machine, and that might otherwise complain about the poor operational condition of most of the games in his establishment.  I chose to leave on my own after the second warning during which time I was followed out the door while continuing to be berated.  I have no desire to ever go back and give this guy another quarter, so he can flip it all to the Salvation Army (400k last year) while continuing to let his games sit broken and refusing help from volunteers to get them repaired in a reasonable time frame.  You\\'d think he could take some of that money and invest it back into the place but I guess that\\'s now how he wants to do business.  It keeps the \"complainers\" away.As a rental tenant and having to deal with this company as a third party, my experience has been HORRIBLE. Called in on Monday to the property manager to report our AC was out. Was called the next day for the electrician to set up an appoinment, (why not an AC tech on the first trip, when that\\'s the issue I called in...) The electrician who showed up in a van that said HVAC/Electrical/etc... told me that the AC unit was the problem and not the electrical....(I knew that). He said that an AC tech would have to come back the next day. Wednesday I was supposed to get a call and they never called. Thursday, NHW called and said a tech was on his way, so I left work, got home and the tech was rude, unprofessional and did not know what he was doing, he figured out that the compressor was bad and would need to be replaced. Friday they sent a tech in the morning to clean to the coils to verify if they could replace the unit under warranty, Friday afternoon, they sent ANOTHER AC tech that verified that the unit would need to be replaced and would be done by Saturday. NO calls TUESDAY and finally had the unprofessional come back and spend the entire day to replace the compressor.... If they would have sent the AC tech the first day, I could have had the problem fixed by Thursday or Friday and been happy. I spent $300 at Lowes to get a portable AC unit and left work on 3 separate occasions.... This company needs to get their SH!* together.... I know when I buy a home that I WON\\'T be using this company for anything....It was obvious that the toilet bowl or seat had not been cleaned.  New room please!  However, I have little faith that any of the rooms are actually clean, based on my first experience.\\n\\nThe room was 80 degrees when I checked in, and the AC is so ancient that after cranking it up all the way for 30 minutes, it only went down about 2 degrees.  \\n\\nHotels.com had this rated as a 3 star hotel. I\\'m not sure how.\\n\\nI won\\'t be back.Was not the cleanest place in Vegas for sure , half of the stations were closed and  all the food looks like over cooked.Not much variety. Not the quality I remembered from past times. What happened here don\\'t know. Hope is just this weekend.\\nBut we left not eating thereThis used to be one of my favorite places, unfortunately, that\\'s no longer the case. I hadn\\'t been in several months but I was going to have some people over so I wanted to put together a really good cheese board. Before, I would always just head over to the cheese display and have one of the staff members help me pick cheeses that would go well with what I was serving. However, I can\\'t do that anymore because the cheese display is no longer there!!! It is now pre-cut and they have it in the furthest fridge from the register, by the wines. Additionally, I wasn\\'t able to buy bread anymore! My disappointment cannot be put into words. The name \"French Grocery\" is false advertisement now. It may be \"French\", but there\\'s nothing \"Grocery\" about it anymore.This place is not good at all. I had a chicken salad sandwich. It was very bad, bread was hard and salad had no flavor. Don\\'t waste your money, even Subway has better sandwiches.I was really hungry today and I decided to stop in cause I was craving some seafood.  For starters the place is not nice inside or out.  I almost considered just not going but since there was a good review I decided to stay.  \\n\\nI ordered the crab and shrimp ceviche tostadas.  I was totally not impressed.  The crab had pieces of shell in it and the shrimp had no flavor.  The only good thing was the coke in a bottle but I can get that at the grocery store so unfortunately I was very disappointed.Some idiot male working put my fiancé on hold for 20 minutes to just hang up on him and not even call back when we were trying to book. No thanks! Horrible customer service. We\\'ll go to another location.Hhhhhhoooorible! Walked out! First of all, I called to get their address and THE RECEPTIONIST HUFFED AND PUFFED  at me because, she didn\\'t know the zip code or the street address. The wait was 45 min and there was a long line of people. So I thought, \"ok,status quo it\\'s a new restaurant\" BUT, most of employees are temporary transplants from other public school restaurants. I manage to get a crush velvet & a bourbon of some sort at the bar from the bar manager as the bar is inhabited by couch potatoes nursing their draft beers. I noticed several group of people leave the line and I am now close enough to see there are empty booths in the bar section, empty tables, empty communal tables large enough to seat a party of 5, ( we are 2). I walk up to the menu management gal at the podium and asked if we could sit at the communal tables and I was told, \"you need a reservation to be seated.\" I think to myself, \"I NEED A RESERVATION TO SIT IN THE BAR AT A COMMUNAL TABLE?\" Why? I quickly scan the dining room on the other side and there are serval tables(besides the booths & tables in the bar) that are EMPTY!i I say to the menu management gal, \" I need a reservation to sit in the bar?\" Since when? Other Public school restaurants allow walk up sit down at the communal tables. Doesn\\'t that defeat the concept of COMMUNAL? The best part was when a gal, I\\'ll just call her \"in charge\" asked if I\\'d like to \" sit out side...... \"....In 110 degree heat?  Really? Now why would she offer outside when there are several available tables in EVERY SECTION OF THAT HUGE  restaurant. If this new restaurant is trying to create the allure of something out of the velvet rope days of Studio 54 they are missing the mark! You are located in a brand new mall with many trendy restaurants. People can easily go elsewhere and will......and I did.  GRADE: FAIL!Cab 389, june 11,2016, 8:45pm pick up at Sky Harbor Airport, PHX.\\nDirty, old, Crown Victoria, that had the front seat full of junk. So the two of us got in back seat. Or TRIED to. Driver had the seat slid back so far, there was only room for one in the backseat. Until we asked the driver to move up so we could both get in. He moved up enough we SQUEEZED in. Driver then proceeded to weave in and out of traffic while eating watermelon from a plastic tray in the front seat junkpile. All the while a mini tv on back of front seat headrest was BLARING an entertainment news show.\\nVery dirty. Very unprofessional. Dangerously distracted driver.\\nNever again.Do not eat here! \\nWe just had lunch here, I found a Roach in our soup, I showed it to the waitress, she said : \\n\"Oh, sorry. you don\\'t have to pay the meal.\" \\nThis means there are a lot ROACHES in their kitchen, and they know it. She wasn\\'t surprise at all.\\n不要在这里吃！\\n我们刚在这里吃午饭，在我们的汤里发现了一个蟑螂，我把它展示给服务员，她说：哦，对不起。你不必付饭费\"，这意味着他们的厨房里有很多蟑螂，他们知道，她一点都不惊讶。Update:\\nThis used to be my fav Thai place but after my order today of What was supposed to be Basil Crispy Pork belly, I\\'m highly disappointed. I have posted a pic here of what should be the crispy meat but is NOTHING but fat. There were maybe three pieces of actual pork that I could eat and NOTHING was crispy. Don\\'t think I\\'ll be back, I paid $14.95 for fat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvery time I get take out, I try something new. Everything is delicious but ommmmmg today, I tried the spicy basil crispy pork and can I just say wow! It was the most delicious dish I\\'ve had in a very long time a. The service is always top notch and quick. I definitely recommend this place!Have you ever been discriminated against? Well if you want to this may be the place for you. Security will treat you like a 3rd class citizen and will verbally berate you and your party. I\\'m saddened by this altercation, but if my description matches your liking for deprecation by others - then this is your spot.I am appalled by the way my father in law was   treated at the new office. He has been a patient for at least 20 years with Dr. Damian never having a problem. This year being over eighty you would think more attentive treatment would be given. He was given medicine that was shooting pains in his head. He made his appointment with same complaint. It was cancelled without notice. He drove 30 miles to just be turned around. Nothing resolved new appointment. This happened three times without anyone seeing him about SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS  from medication that this place prescribed. I can find no reason for this type of treatment of a patient EVER! A call stating prior appointment cancelled or Dr. Review complaint and come up with solution to medication. The receptionist proceeded to rip his appointment paper and say \"Well that\\'s how it is.\" BEWARE if elderly!The pizza is just blah!!! The overall flavor is just bland, there\\'s no POW BANG. \\nThe only good thing they have going for them is the fact that they\\'re open late.In Vegas for a youth basketball tournament and tried to sit as a team in the restaurant. After taking our orders, we were notified that we would have to split up by family/table  because it was more conveinent for the servers when making out the checks. We sat there for another 25 min and no one ever came to take our order nor did they deliver the original round of beverages. On the way out I mentioned this to \"Mike\" the manager and all he did was turn around and walk away. I also mentioned it was my son\\'s 11th birthday and all the kid wanted was a milk shake.....which never arrived. This place has themselves confused with a 5 star restaurant.'"

Most uncomfortable \\\\\"romantic\\\\\" evening of my life...\\\\n\\\\nNow to the food.  The Valentine\\'s Day meal was a choice of appetizer to share (except for one - they sold out the night before), a \\\\\"salad\\\\\", choice of any appetizer on the menu (again except for the New Zealand Rack of Lamb, because it too sold out the night before.), a Chocolate Creme Brulet to share for dessert, and a bottle of Nero D\\'Avola (which we were told is a $35 bottle of wine). We ordered two bowls of soup to go along with the special.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe soup - Lobster Bisque (Delicious) and Minestrone with sausage ( missing the sausage and the vegetable were literally giant sized. It was like eating a salad with broth and rice in it). However it did taste quite nice.\\\\n\\\\nThe appetizer - Artichokes with Prosciutto.. YUMMO!\\\\n\\\\nThe salad - hmm not what I had in mind. A tiny plate of Feta Cheese, cucumber, pear in balsamic vinegar and gosh knows what else...but NOT a traditional salad..So beware!  Taste was great, but if you are expecting a bowl of leafy greens and some toppings...This it is not.\\\\n\\\\nThe meal - Veal with shrimp and gnocchi..Quite pleasing to the palette.\\\\n\\\\nThe dessert - Chocolate Creme Brulet...   Umm not so much..it was quite clearly 3/4 cup of Chocolate Mousse with a sliced strawberry on top and a store bought sugar cookie in the shape of a heart.  Yes it did taste good, however...where was the Creme Brulet the waiter raved about?\\\\n\\\\nThe wine - Nero D\\'Avola...yes I am a red wine drinker, the wine was delicious.  But upon looking it up when we returned to the hotel room...found it only sold for $10 - $13 a bottle...Why the lie? We would have ordered the special anyway...\\\\n\\\\nThe atmosphere...beautiful, romantic (if you like sharing intimate moments with strangers) but it was pleasantly dark with candles and Christmas lights through out. They had an electric fireplace when we first sat down we observed and enjoyed the heat coming from it, since as you know we dress up, not dress warm when going out to dinner. The place lost half of its power 5 minutes after sitting down. The manager  chose to turn the fireplace off, even though it stayed lit and running during the power outage.  By the time I left, my toes were frozen.\\\\n\\\\nWe finished eating and paid for the bill at 7:50p.m. I turned around and noticed FOUR empty 2 person tables. They had never been sat, but we had to sit with an unfamiliar couple! \\\\n\\\\nUpon leaving the hostess who was so sweet and friendly upon arrival was short and sarcastic in her good bye and have a nice evening.\\\\n\\\\nWould I go back when in town again? No.  At the risk of being sat in that situation again.  The food can be the most delicious in the world, but I still prefer and deserve privacy when dining.\\\\n\\\\nAnd to the lady we sat next to...Good luck on your birth, maybe your dislike for cheese will go away after you give birth.\", \"date\": \"2011-02-13 16:59:31\", \"KaggleID\": 35}\\n',\n",

Paying an annual fee, I\\'m expecting receiving services which are at least at the average level; however, LifeScape disappointed me again and again over the years. I have to give credit to their office environment though, it\\'s always quiet and clean, and the receptionists are always friendly.\\\\n\\\\nThere\\'re a few reasons I don\\'t like it there:\\\\n1. I feel like the doctor is always suggesting me with some medicine/samples/tests, and some of them are not necessary at all. For example, the doctor suggested me with a special blood test, twice, saying that the test would be very beneficial for me and my insurance should cover the cost. I believed her and had my blood drawn at their lab. Later I got a bill for almost $2000 (I know LifeScape always charges high prices, luckily I have a good health insurance so i don\\'t really care, but still, $2000 for a blood test is too much! ) I called my insurance company, my insurance company said the test was actually done in a out-of-state lab so they will only pay for a small portion. I immediately called LifeScape and left a message, no one replied. A few days later I decided to go to their office in person, they lied to me that the blood test would just cost whatever my insurance company is willing to pay, and I would not be charged for extra. I believed them and left. But a few weeks later I received another bill. I called them a few more times explaining the issue. They told me that a specialist would call me back, but nobody ever did. I\\'m really disappointed. How can people trust them if they do business like that!!! What\\'s worse, up to this day, they still haven\\'t informed me anything about the bill, nor the blood test result itself.\\\\n\\\\n2. The waiting time in the clinic is too long. I ALWAYS have to wait there for 30-50 minutes passed the appointment time. I know the doctor is busy, but the patient\\'s time is precious too. I don\\'t like taking my work hours off and just wasting it on waiting for the doctor. And when I finally get to meet with the doctor, I can tell that she is not patient enough. She seems in a hurry, I know she wants to finish up our conversation asap and move on to the next patient.\\\\n\\\\n3. They don\\'t have xRay machines. If you are need to get some xRay or CT scan done, I suggest you going somewhere else, even some small clinics have xRay machines. \\\\n\\\\nI normally only write positive reviews online, but this time i want to let people know about what\\'s really going on there.

I especially liked the Italian dressing with a little Feta cheese in it.  Bread was OK.  My steak was great, tender, flavorful, and perfectly cooked.  Served with a (undercooked) baked potato, and sauteed mushrooms.  My friend ordered the walleye.  I was a big fan, but he said it was a little bland compared to what he catches in Minnesota.

They have $10 sandwiches, too, but they\\'re not served on Fri/Sat until after 9pm.  Seems fair.\\\\n\\\\nService:  Service was slow, although it was Opening Night.  They also screwed up my friend\\'s appetizer, serving him the wrong kind of wing sauce.  However, the people could not have been nicer.  The owner apologized and bought us desserts.

I paid extra for a specific move date and time, as well as a \\'special handling fee\\' because of my piano. \\\\n\\\\nWhen they arrive for the pick-up - 2 days late 6 hours after they were supposed to be there - they didn\\'t come prepared for a piano. My dad and uncle had to find 2x4\\'s to use as a ramp and help the movers hold it and roll it off the porch. This is a stage piano, the wheels aren\\'t really meant for rolling around cement! After loading everything and telling my parents they were headed my way (Virginia), my stuff is taken from Wyoming to Seattle, then back to Vegas where it was put in storage without my knowledge or permission. I only found out because I kept calling to see the whereabouts of the truck so I could plan accordingly. After repeated phone calls, and finally the threat of legal action, my items were put back on a truck and started the journey East. \\\\n\\\\nFinally, they call to tell me they\\'ll be there on June xx, which is exactly during the 3-day window I said I would be out of the state and not be able to receive the truck - again, all covered BEFORE the contract was even signed. So I\\'m told if I can\\'t get a friend to meet them at my house and let them in, they\\'d go on to New York with my stuff and I\\'d have to pay an additional fee to get it, whenever they brought it back to me, which would be at their discretion. Luckily, I was able to get a hold of someone and coordinate with them to receive the shipment, upon which he started taking pictures the moment the truck was opened. (see below). After they had unloaded everything and AFTER I had confirmed 3 times over the course of this month that they had the proper equipment, they realize that in fact, they don\\'t have anything to move the piano. So they decide they\\'ll go to Home Depot, hire random men, and carry/lift the piano into my house. You don\\'t LIFT a piano! So my friend that\\'s there says no, it\\'s too heavy, you need the proper equipment, I suggest you go find it. So then they tell him that they need to get on the road to New York for their next job so they\\'ll just go put my piano in a warehouse until I was back so I\\'d let them deliver it. Again, they\\'re told no, at which point the driver calls me while I\\'m in the airport and says if I don\\'t let them into my house I\\'d have to pay a second delivery fee. I told them not to leave the state with my piano and I\\'d call them right back - so I call my friend and ask what\\'s going on; he gives me the scoop. I asked him if he\\'d run up the street - about 4 blocks from my house - and secure a storage unit that these guys could back the truck right up to the ramp, get the piano on a dolly and store it there for two days til I could get a professional. He said OK, and while I\\'m still on the phone, I hear him say exactly that to the driver. I call the driver back myself and say the same thing. I literally asked them to wait 15 minutes while we got this taken care of; he said OK. My friend leaves, gets the paperwork for a storage unit, comes back and these guys have unloaded the piano, ROLLED it down the sidewalk (no dolly), tried to lift it up my 4 steps, DROPPED it, eventually go it inside, and we\\'re RUNNING TO THEIR TRUCK when my friend gets back. They hadn\\'t given him the inventory sheets or had him sign anything, so he hollers at them and runs after. He had to jump in his own vehicle to chase them down and cut them off before they stopped. At that point they gave him the paperwork - still not signed - and took off again. \\\\n\\\\nAs soon as I got home that same evening I went right to the piano to take a look and started taking pictures. I called the driver and asked what had happened. He said nothing, everything was fine, no damage. I called BS and told him I\\'m standing in my living room looking at the damage.

The corn tortillas really make a difference.  The pork chop feature was really good.  My friend found it to be a little fatty but for those of us who love pork fat it was perfect.

Definitely not bad or awful, but maybe if I sandwiched a later supper  between undulating bare bellied vixens and a couple of Kingfishers, I\\'d stumble out with a hazier (and happier ) overall impression.  \\\\n\\\\nNothing I\\'ve ever eaten here was truly bad enough to take back - or savory enough to inspire a return visit. Portions tend to be small and sauces are, by and large, mild and rather one dimensional.  Other than the garlic naan, I cant  remember a dish smelling really awesome as it wafted by, which is a shame considering Indian cuisine is among the world\\'s most aromatic.   \\\\n\\\\nI was eager to share yesterday\\'s lamb boti kabob, as the portion was good sized - about 15-20 small cubes of lamb (not mega kabob sized cubes, but a very respectable portion for $10-11), on the usual tandoori bed of onions and peppers.  The lamb exterior was nice & crusty, but the inside wasnt moist and tender like you\\'d expect from tandoori - instead it was hard, chewy and disappointing.  Companion\\'s entree was 3 tiny vegetable fritters or dumplings buried in a thick sauce, that looked more like an appetizer.  Chicken dishes are generally better - the tandoori version is good, and similar to most Indian joints.  I recommend the three hot relishes (red sauce, green puree, and pickled peppers) provided tableside, as house preparations, at least in my experience, tend to be mild. \\\\n\\\\nServers are generally Anglo, pleasant and competent during the meal, but just about every time we walk in for dinner at 5 or 5:30, the entire operation seems almost startled by our presence. Nobody\\'s overtly rude, but instead of a really warm welcome, you kind of get four or five employees hanging out at the bar staring at you, as if mentally choosing straws to see who has to deal with the first dinner customer of the evening. It\\'s not oppressive, but it\\'s happened more than once and I\\'m not crazy about the vibe.  \\\\n\\\\nI do like the complimentary, self serve chai tea and open kitchen, providing an opportunity to stretch one\\'s legs and socialize a bit. Nice touches.   The menu is extensive, all told about sixty items, and reasonably priced for Indian food. Indian textiles, jewelry and artwork is often on display, for sale, and the house music is too loud if you have the misfortune to be seated under a ceiling speaker. It got turned down, eventually, but any restaurant with a few years under it\\'s belt ought to understand customary American tolerances better than that.  \\\\n\\\\nThe atmosphere is up and down. Food\\'s OK. Service is OK. Ask my family and they\\'ll each give it four or five stars. In my book, Tandoori Times is just OK.\", \"date\": \"2008-08-18 07:30:29\", \"KaggleID\": 216}\\n',\n",

We ordered: oysters on the half shell with the siracha lime dressing ( some of our parties first experience-success), a meat and cheese board (jellies were weird-wouldn\\'t order again), chicken wings, roasted chicken, lobster roll, sliders, macaroni and cheese, green beans, steak tartare ( skip), a breakfast dish, mussels and calamari. For the most part our entire table enjoyed all of the food and was very happy.  The rings were perhaps the biggest hit ( they are a little spicy and smokey)  resulting in one member of our party declaring we must perfect our smoking technique in order to do wings like that at home.  The green beans were also a big hit, which is shocking because we were not that excited about ordering beans.

You can have chicken, fish or tofu burritos, tacos, or all kinds of plates.  Jonathon at the register was extremely friendly and recommended the enchiladas. You basically order once you come in, they give you a number and then you sit and watch the awesome projector showing extreme sports clips of guys eating it and doing gnarly tricks.

We had a $50 gift card to play with. We started things off with a very tasty beet and goat cheese salad for $7.95. Fresh and warm honey wheat and sourdough loaves were also served and were very satisfying.\\\\n\\\\nFor our entrees, my wife ordered the smoked salmon which was thinly sliced and doused with a balsamic glaze for $11.95, and I ordered the French country salad with chicken for $15.95. Both were quite good. We intentionally kept things light, knowing that we were each going to do some serious damage to cheesecake for dessert. \\\\n\\\\nAs an admitted dessert snob, I did have my doubts regardless of the fact that cheesecake was their specialty. I never consider any dessert unless it\\'s made in house and most of the time they are not.\\\\n\\\\nAfter drooling over the choices on the menu and in the display case, we finally settled on the Oreo and the praline. Slices are huge and run a very reasonable $7.95 when compared to similar restaurants. More importantly, they were other worldly! The Oreo cheesecake had fresh crunchy Oreos baked in, an Oreo crust and was topped with crushed Oreos and fresh whipped cream. The praline was equally as good and was topped with Nutella and fresh creme. No we didn\\'t finish them both but we sure did enjoy them there and at home. I am nonsmoker, and never have, but I almost had to have a cigarette afterwards. Yes it was that good!\\\\n\\\\nHey what can I say, I was wrong. No wonder people wait 2 hours to dine here.

Now me and my girlfriend are sitting watching the game, the cheese sticks arrive, they\\'re pretty good, and everything is cool.\\\\n\\\\n  Then the waiter comes back within about a minute of bringing the cheese sticks and asks if we\\'re ready to order, we shake our heads as we haven\\'t even finished eating the cheese sticks.\\\\n\\\\nWithin another minute, he\\'s back again, so we just go ahead and order our entrees and everything is cool, the waiter vanishes, and we\\'re back to watching the football game.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWe get our entrees, I ordered a Big Jack Daddy burger, normally delicious but somewhat off, the pulled pork was cold, the burger was dry and had barely any BBQ sauce on it so I asked the waiter for some.  My girlfriend\\'s biting into her chicken tenders which also were somewhat under-par.      The waiter comes back with the BBQ sauce, then disappears again, we\\'re watching the football game and within a few minutes, he\\'s back, asking if we want desert.................um, while I\\'m not even halfway done with my entree.       We say no, go back to our food and at this point, some Buffalo Wild Wings honcho, maybe a manager stops by our table and asks how things are, I say alright although privately I\\'m starting to feel a bit crowded.\\\\n\\\\n  Then as I\\'m just finishing my entree, the waiter comes by, swoops the plate and takes off.

I made a point of asking him if maybe they were closing early or something and he got defensive and walked off.    \\\\n\\\\n  At that point, I didn\\'t see him the rest of the night, but I did notice on the bill that he had the audacity to charge us for the extra BBQ sauce I asked for to cover up the dryness of the overcooked burger and the fact that they barely put any sauce on it to begin with.    \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n The fact I was being charged for BBQ sauce in a place that serves it up en masse was ridiculous.     What\\'s next?   Fork and knife rental fees?   First time I\\'ve been charged for that at any restaurant, and especially at Buffalo Wild Wings.

The sad truth is that, over the past 6 months to a year, Water Wings has gone downhill dramatically and drastically. My kids no longer swim at Water Wings for several reasons, but my chief concern was many new and inexperienced swim teachers that simply put, do not know how to effectively teach children to swim. Unfortunately, most of the seasoned instructors from years past either no longer work with the company or have moved to California to work at the newest location. I paid for private lessons (not cheap) and in many classes the primary instructor was busy \\\\\"training\\\\\" a new instructor or chatting with a colleague. I understand training is necessary but it shouldn\\'t take away or undermine the meat of the lesson, especially considering the cost and limited time allotment.\\\\n\\\\nAs a parent one of my main concerns - besides the instructors\\' inexperience - is the lack of accountability for children\\'s safety. Employees are neither background checked nor drug tested, which in my opinion, is unacceptable when staff is in direct contact with children. (Not only, but you are quite literally putting your children\\'s lives in their hands when you hand them over in a pool.) Additionally, the pool and facility is often dirty and unsanitary. This became more apparent to me after switching my kids to swim at another facility. There have been many incidents over the years (dirty play area, grimy shower area, floating grossness in the pool) but the one that stands out to me was when an individual had vomited in the locker room. I notified the staff and instead of properly cleaning it up, they had sprayed it repeatedly with a noxious cleaner (but did not wipe or clean the area).

This was not the case and eventually I did have to enlist the help of the internet for translation purposes.  But, MacKimmie is so magical, THAT IT MADE ME THINK I COULD JUST LEARN SPANISH BY STARING AT IT. \\\\n\\\\nMacKimmie would also remind me of the fragile and beautiful tangibility of books. It was in this very library that I fell in love with a first pressing of Kerouac\\'s \\\\\"Big Sur,\\\\\" worn and weathered and dying to be checked out and rescued. While working in the library for awhile if I had nothing to do, I would often escape to the 10th floor and spend a few hours reading through Bukowski poetry.

Our secondary concern was damage to the hood (also while unattended in a parking lot but some time earlier).\\\\n\\\\n911 Collision did a reasonable job on the bumper - covered under insurance after our $500 deductible was met.  The color doesn\\'t exactly match but then it doesn\\'t scream out either.  One of the people that works there told me that you can never get the color to match because the bumper is plastic and the body is sheet metal.  I\\'ll go on record now by calling that out as complete hogwash - Detroit, Germany, and Japan do it all day long.  The color might be hard to match for a host of other plausible and legitimate reasons but not because one is metal and the other is plastic.\\\\n\\\\nSo we have established that, at best, the work is mediocre and they like to lie about it.  Now on to the hood.\\\\n\\\\nThe hood was originally quoted as a $1000 correction because they would have to paint the WHOLE FRONT COWL - hood, fenders, grill, bumper, etc.  All for two ding\\'s no larger than a plug nickel.  And $1000 is the REDUCED price because we already had the car in their shop.  Normally it would have been more.\\\\n\\\\nWe decided that was too much and went with Option-B: they pop the dents, wet sand the area and then blend in a little touch up paint, wet sand again to smooth it out, clear the area and wet sand again.  All for $300.  Not bad - right?  Wrong.\\\\n\\\\nIt looks like all they did was pop the dents.  Is still isn\\'t smooth, The scratches are very obvious, and I cant tell that it was wet sanded at all.  I think they just let the shop lackey have a crack at it with the touch up paint you get at Auto Zone.  Had I known that this is what $300 gets me, I would have passed.  It looks Rookie all the way.

Although my first session went well, I could tell Meredith had a particular enjoyment for her male clients over her female. However, I returned because she did my teeth fine and I was pleased with the results. When I went in today, I was in the whitening room with three other gentlemen. My appointment started out well, although, being a person who is in the service industry, I always attend to my female clientele first when a couple arrives. Unbothered by those signs, I waited my turn. She checked on me once after my original 30 minute timer to ask if I was ok. She attended my boyfriend on numerous occasions, as well as the other men, and would exit the room without even asking me or looking to see if I had any irritation. Half way through, another woman had showed up who she was explaining the deals to in the lobby. While she admits timers must be reset half way through the process, she reset my boyfriends, left, rest the gentleman furthest away from me who had time to come in, redeem his deal, get set, and gave his timer done, before me, then left, and at this point my time was at 10 minutes. So, she should have reset it 5 minutes ago, according to her. While I sat there patiently this whole time with major pain in my gums, i watched the time until the lamp shut off. Not only had she reset two others, explained deals to other guest, but she never once checked on my time. When my light turned off, I released the stance of my mouth to a more relaxed state, assuming I was only getting a thirty minute session instead of the usual 45, because she had yet to come in. At this point, the teeth formula was not only burning the gum she neglected for 25 minutes now, but it began to burn my lips. I began squealing and slapping my chair trying to get her attention from the other room in a panic. I was in so much pain, that by the time she entered the room I was already out of my chair. She finally then acknowledged me, and asked if she could put vitamin E on my gum burn (pictured below). At this point, she has treated two other gums burns, while neglecting me, and I was so irritated that I had to suffer, all I wanted was to leave. While I waited for my boyfriend, she kept harassing me about the issue. Saying, \\\\\"well burns come with teeth whitening.\\\\\" While I totally agree, and under justifiable circumstances would not be as irritate, it could have easily been avoid if she had checked on me even a second time, so I could let her know. Not only did she never check on my physical health, she couldn\\'t even take two seconds to reset the timer, which she even admitted to me. Her accuse was that she was coming in to do it, but I had the light off for a solid two minutes before I couldn\\'t stand the pain. She admitted it should be reset every 15 minutes, which means for 25 minutes she did not bother to help me at all. Her guest in the lobby then proceeded to attack me as well, simply because I wanted to leave after the way I was treated. I also expected a refund for not getting a complete session today, due to the neglect, and the fact I won\\'t be returning for my last, she had failed to do that. She was even screaming from the door, and continued to until my boyfriend and I were down the steps. I have never in my life been more appalled by a grown woman\\'s behavior, who claims to be in the business for \\\\\"10 years.\\\\\" Admit your wrongs, but don\\'t make your guest feel unwelcome because you can\\'t do you job properly.\", \"date\": \"2018-01-30 23:07:38\"}\\n',\n",

This line can get extremely long yet the earlier you get in line your choice of seating significantly improves.So...after waiting in line for a few hours we were notified the lower portion of the theater was reserved for paid customers who previously purchased wristbands for $100 (including alcohol and hot dogs) and instead we would be seated in the balcony portion of the theater.No problem, something different, we said.

Once we take our seats one of us ( we\\'re in a group of 8 ) will hold the seats while the rest of us will go out to the casino floor and gamble or go the the sports book and place a couple last minute bets.Please note the patrons that leave the auditorium will receive a hand stamp or wristband to allow reentry to the theater.

Nice work Westgate.\\\\n\\\\nSo we were seated upstairs...stuck. With no food or soda available for purchase. Only beer and water was sold in the balcony food counter. That was at 1:45 p.m. After vigorously complaining to Westgate staff ( to ushers with yellow jackets and security with black jackets ) at 3:04 pm wristbands were given out. At 3:18 hot dogs and soda were made available for sale in the balcony.

That was our experience.\\\\n\\\\nSome call it cozy but for me the table layout in the main dining room is claustrophobically cramped.  If you want a seat on the patio on Friday or Saturday in the summer, make sure to reserve several days in advance.\\\\n\\\\nReservations are taken by phone and I will admit they were very helpful even if it did take 10 rings for them to answer... I was surprised that a restaurant in this price range did not have online reservations!\\\\n\\\\nBeing in a house transformed into a restaurant, the entry hallway is narrow, so if someone is going out, nobody can go in and vice versa.  \\\\n\\\\nSo if you are even a little claustrophobic,  be warned, you won\\'t be comfortable here.  \\\\n\\\\nThe food:\\\\n\\\\nComplimentary bruschetta:  A plain Pizza crust with bruschetta topping which falls off and wasn\\'t that flavourful. Go to La Bruschetta to find out how it is meant to taste.\\\\n\\\\nCaesar salad:  Crispy romaine, hints of fresh garlic and Parmesan but the dressing seemed watery and the croutons were like rocks.\\\\n\\\\nBread basket:  Now I know why the croutons are like rocks, the crust on the bread was so hard I was worried I would break a tooth, and I also found it strange to be served whole wheat bread, when I was expecting crusty Italian bread.  \\\\n\\\\nSpaghetti Carbonara:   The reason we came was because Hubby was craving Carbonara and based on great reviews we thought we would try it here but he found Fieramosca\\'s version disappointingly bland, even with extra Parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper.  \\\\n\\\\nLinguini DI Mamma Ninetta:  I love mushrooms but was surprised that there were so many in this dish... With just 3 small shrimp and a few small pieces of chicken scattered throughout, and very little garlic flavour, this dish was edible but far from great.\\\\n\\\\nTiramisu:  No coffee flavour!  I have made Tiramisu before and have had it in countless restaurants and I know the lady fingers are to be dipped in coffee before being covered in cream, and these missed the coffee altogether, and the cream here seemed to just be whipped cream, none of the yummy marscapone that I was expecting.   Libretto\\'s Tiramisu in a jar might not be traditional in presentation but has all the flavour that Fieramosca\\'s lacked.  My favourite dessert when done well, I left disappointed.\\\\n\\\\nLemon Sorbet:  Frozen sorbet in a scooped out lemon, menu says imported from Italy.  I actually liked it better than the sad face Tiramisu so hubby swapped with me because while he usually loves anything lemon, he found an odd aftertaste.  I joked it was the jet fumes to bring frozen sorbet from Italy but the truth is, it was the perfume worn by the woman at the table next to ours.  Thankfully she arrived as we had dessert, so our entire meal was not ruined, but the smell was so overpowering that it gave us both a headache and we wanted to get out of there fast, since with the cramped layout she was almost on top of our table.\\\\n\\\\nLadies, please don\\'t drown yourself in perfume and go to a restaurant!

The pizza is pretty mediocre, but it\\'s really cheap and convenient. The cheesy bread, subs, chicken fingers, and onion rings are pretty delicious. We always order online (which I love), it\\'s right around the corner, delivery is always under 45 minutes (yes, we\\'re that lazy and really hate winter), and the delivery people are always super nice. Sadly, they had to go and screw up the good thing we had going. \\\\n\\\\nLast time we ordered it was for pick-up as 20 years of junk food ordering has taught me pick-up to takes half the time of delivery. We ordered cheesy bread, a Philly sub, and onion rings. I asked for ranch instead of marinara with the cheesy bread and requested ranch for the onion rings.\\\\n\\\\nI paid in advance and added a 20% tip (on take-out) thinking that would help make up for any \\\\\"inconvenience\\\\\" or cost of my ranch requests (we ordered the exact same thing for delivery the previous time with absolutely no problem, by the way). My husband showed up about 20 minutes after I ordered. Not only wasn\\'t the food ready, but apparently they hadn\\'t even started it and were in no hurry. He waited almost another HOUR (seriously--from ordering til he got home was an hour fifteen and it\\'s about a one minute drive) to get our food. They didn\\'t comp or discount or offer any vouchers or coupons or anything. \\\\n\\\\nWhen we opened our food there were no sauces of any kind. I\\'d waited a long time and was starving and pretty pissed about this oversight after all that. I hopped in the car because, as I said, it\\'s literally around the corner, and junk food just ain\\'t the same without ranch for dippin. \\\\n\\\\nI walked in. Everyone was in the kitchen (no one at the counter), but I was clearly seen, though nobody shouted a greeting or \\\\\"I\\'ll be right with you.\\\\\" Finally a girl walked toward the front, though again not at a speed that anyone in the restaurant business should use. I told her my husband had just waited a ridiculously long time for our take-out order and when he got home there were no sauces, could I just have like six containers of ranch that we should have gotten with our order. Now that may have been an excessive amount, but I had low blood sugar brain. And at this point I figured they\\'d throw anything at me to appease a dissatisfied customer (because they\\'d screwed up!). Instead, she looked at the computer and said she needed to get the person who took the order. Why? I have no idea. But she said she was new, so I said fine. She went in to the kitchen to tell another girl who dropped what she was doing to go tell an older man, who I assume is the owner, most certainly the boss. Expecting him to greet me with a smile and an apology, or at least a how can I help you, I was taken aback to get a brusk questioning of who I was and what I ordered. He also needed to look it up on the computer for some godforsaken reason. It was like they all had amnesia! You don\\'t remember the tall skinny dude who JUST left after waiting for his order for an hour?! He told me what I ordered like I was on crack and what was the problem. I said yes, I know what I ordered, but I requested ranch, and even added a generous tip in case he wanted to charge me for it. Again, he rudely asked me how many I wanted, incredulous I was asking. It was like the freakin inquisition. Do they have a problem with ranch robberies??? Are people always walking in and making up stories about how they didn\\'t get ranch with their orders?? He started taking containers out of the fridge. I was so upset by this point that I don\\'t even know what he said that prompted me say \\\\\"Wow, you are really something else.\\\\\" There were four containers of ranch on the counter which I snatched while I could and turned around to walk out, at which point he yelled after me how they\\'re 75 cents a piece. I may have muttered something in return as the door was closing behind me. \\\\n\\\\nI honestly think this was the most disrespectful customer service I have ever received. It certainly tops the list as worst interaction/confrontation with a stranger. I can\\'t believe anyone would treat or talk to anyone like that, let alone a proprietor to a customer. I worked in a restaurant for seven years and one of the cardinal rules is own up and apologize when you make a mistake--99% of the time people will completely understand. Offer them a discount or a freebie and the mistake is completely forgotten.\\\\n\\\\nI realize no one cares or will ever read this. My husband has already chastised me for wasting my energy on it, but I was just so incredulous about the entire thing. It was cathartic. I feel better.

In total, three steaks at our table were seriously overcooked. In a steakhouse. With a man tasked with grilling the steaks. Sigh. The fourth steak, smoked prime rib, was cooked properly. But the prime rib is cooked ahead if time, right? How was I prepared for this overcooked piece of meat? How did this only occasional red-meat-eater suspect that my steak would not be treated with attentive care? \\\\n\\\\nI\\'ll tell you. When we walked in there was a large grill at the front of the restaurant with a number if steaks cooking on it. But the chef was not watching the meat. He wasn\\'t even in front of the grill. He was nowhere to be seen as we walked through the doors. And there were at least 4 steaks cooking when we arrived. So I figured that my steak would receive the same lack of attention.  \\\\n\\\\nI ordered a simple naked potato and a side salad to accompany my steak. Both were fine. But there is not much room to mess up a potato and iceberg, is there? People rave about the garlic bread and I think it\\'s because the rest of the meal is so mediocre, that the cheesy bread becomes the highlight if the meal. It was just OK. The most inexperienced cook could make it at home with sourdough, butter, and three types of cheese. \\\\n\\\\nA few people in our party ordered the mushroom rice side dish and it was not good. After tasting it, I was grateful to have passed on this wet, mush. \\\\n\\\\nSERVICE: Our waitress was very attentive and responsive. She was more than willing to return the overcooked steaks. \\\\n\\\\nI won\\'t be back, but I\\'m glad to have visited this historic spot.\\\\n\\\\nService: 4 stars\\\\n\\\\nKitch: 4 stars\\\\n\\\\nFood: 1 star\", \"date\": \"2013-06-24 06:42:29\"}\\n',\n",

The detail had been a little rushed because the location was extra busy that day and they were also short staffed. As a result there appeared to be some minor scratching. Jared was immediately on the ball and worked to have the scratched buffed out and fixed. I was very impressed with him as I watched and saw him masterfully handle other customer issues like mine. I was impressed enough that I told the man to his face that I was going to be a loyal customer directly as a result of his good work.\\\\n\\\\nI am not good with names or dates, but I remember this man\\'s name, because he does his job with pride. After Jared, I became a fastpass customer and still remain one.\\\\n\\\\nCOBBLESTONE, PAY CLOSE ATTENTION! THIS IS THE KIND OF EMPLOYEE YOU NEED MORE OF!\\\\n\\\\nNow the Bad: 7700 S Autoplex\\\\n\\\\nI first went to this location because I needed an oil change and the 616 location does not do oil changes. I got a heavy up-sale routine but went with it anyway. I also got a wash that was far below the standards of the 616 location. I let that all slide, as just being an off day.\\\\n\\\\nI then went a second time for a wash, also below standard. I also let that slide.\\\\n\\\\nI then went to get a wash yesterday. Not only was the wash worse than ever, but the car interior looked worse coming out than it did before I came! To begin with the carpets were barely vacuumed at all. There was dust and small dirt everywhere never even attempted to be cleaned. The only real evidence that they did anything was white stuff rubbed into the grain of dash around the driver\\'s side air conditioning vent. There were also several new white smudges on the back of the seats as well as the seat back and headrests of both sides of the back seats.\\\\n\\\\nWhen I pointed out the mess on the dash, initially they tried to say this was the dash paint wearing off. I was able to remove some of this white stuff (that looked a lot like a car wax) with my thumb nail. The manager, who I do not remember his name (nor is he worthy of being remembered) wanted to just get his day over and wanted to fill out a damage report. I remained reasonable but refused to just drop it because I knew they caused the problem. At this point 3 of the employees were involved and seemed more concerned with getting the day over than fixing the problem. They were disrespectful and discourteous.\\\\n\\\\nFinally after they saw the light of day that it was not damage, but just some stuff that they managed to smear into the dash. They asked me to come back the next day. Obviously fixing the problem right then was just too much effort.\\\\n\\\\nI went home, frustrated but moderately satisfied that the car would be fixed the next day.\\\\n\\\\nThe next day while examining the contents of the back seat that were just tossed about with no care, and no effort to clean anything, I discovered a pair of women\\'s panties placed in the center of the floor of the back seat. Keep in mind that the floor mats were not vacuumed, but tossed on the back seat. \\\\n\\\\nI knew these were not my wife\\'s who is a small woman because these were of a rather robust size. Also these were obviously clean panties, so I gather that one of the employees has a fat girlfriend or wife who is missing something from the laundry.\\\\n\\\\nI suspect these were a gift for my complaining about the condition of the car and the fact I was making them late from rushing home to see the next episode of moronic reality TV.\\\\n\\\\nAs a result I was livid. I had tried to be cooperative and reasonable and was rewarded with this insult added to injury.\\\\n\\\\nI went to the 7700 location immediately and complained. They clearly found the actions of the yet undetermined employee very humorous, and were going to make no attempt to secure an apology or terminate the maleficent employee. \\\\n\\\\nThey reluctantly looked at fixing the area of the dash they had messed up, and made a halfhearted attempt to fix it. At this point the dash looked a little better but not the same as it did when I brought the car in. I was tired of dealing with these lazy incompetent fools who had no pride in their work and decided to take the car back to the 616 location.\\\\n\\\\nJared to the rescue:\\\\n\\\\nI took the car directly to the 616 location and saw Jared busily working with his staff. I pulled up and was greeted courteously by one of the staff. After being checked in I called out to Jared and explained the situation to him. He dutifully sought out to resolve this issues and return my car to its former glory.  This was not his problem, his staff did not cause it but he fixed it.\\\\n\\\\nLesson: NEVER GO TO THE 7700 LOCATION! ALWAYS GO TO THE 616 LOCATION!\\\\n\\\\nCOBBLESTONE, BAD MANAGERS MAKE FOR A BAD STAFF. GREAT MANAGERS MAKE FOR A GREAT STAFF.\", \"date\": \"2015-06-21 00:25:48\"}\\n',\n",

I was so dissapointed with everything that once I got home I had to write a review.  First of All I am Vietnamese and Pho is such a soulful dish, the pho I had today was the worst thing ever.  My parents came to visit with my sister and a friend, and after a long day we wanted to finish with a hot bowl of pho.  I have seen this place, I have even walked by it when I ate at Sura.  There was a smell so tantalizing that I had to go and try it. I thought it would be a good idea to try Jenni Pho Grill tonight.\\\\n\\\\nWe walk in saw that the place was not too busy maybe about 7 tables.  We got seated fairly quickly.  Our server was pretty nice, my parents attempted to order in vietnamese but the server informed us that he did not speak it.  Cool cool, no big deal, he seemed like a nice kid.  After that it went downhill from there.  We ordered three bowls of the Pho Dac biet, and two orders of the pho tai.  We finished our order with two thai teas, the jenni jelly drink, and two waters.  \\\\n\\\\nMy family waited around, no waters, no drinks nothing.  We watched three tables get seated order their food and get their food before we even had anything on our table!  after a 25 min wait, our waiter finally comes back with two waters.  We asked why the service was so slow, he stated that there was only two waiters and said sorry.  So it was fine for now.  After we got the water nothing else came to us.  We watched as the tables that came in after us eat, and one even finished before we were served.  After another 35 minutes, our food finally came out.  First the two dac biet bowls, then the last three.  Finally the drinks came out as well.  I have worked at a boba place before, making thai teas should not take a hour.  For waiting for so long I was really anticipating for a great bowl of pho.  Oh man was I wrong.  The broth was lukewarm, it could not even finish cooking my meat.  The broth tasty funky as if it was made with a pre made powder.  My parents and I watched a one cook was constantly tasting the broth, and we saw no bones that make a great broth.  The bowl was mostly disappointing broth.  There were very little meat and noodles.  We ate, and we wanted to get out as soon as possible.  We asked for a to go cup for the thai tea because it took so long we were just going to take it home.  It took almost another five minutes just to get a plastic cup.  \\\\n\\\\nIn the end it was just terrible.  My family and I went home unhappy.  And the thing is I love food, I work in the industry so I timing is very important.  Having only two servers is rough but it can not be the only excuse.  If there was something wrong or if it was going to take a little longer, they should inform the customers.  The worst part was watching tables come in before us and eat before we got anything.  I am never going back.  I really hope they clean up their act, there are a lot of pho places out here and if they don\\'t fix things it will be buried beneath the rest.\", \"date\": \"2015-05-26 07:46:21\"}\\n',\n",

So we told the hostess that this waiter is waiting on a table after us, and she said oh well we said there would probably be a long wait, and the hostess had the audacity to say \\\\\"Oh but they serve the people who come before\\\\\" and I said, we were before them, we been waiting 30min at this table and you know this because you sat us at our table\\\\\" she said it depends.

The pick up process is pretty simple.  You can either go to a customer service rep or use their self-serve kiosk, which is what I ended up doing.\\\\n\\\\nThe lady who was assisting me on the kiosk phone was pretty friendly, but she was doing a lot of up-sell so it was kind of bothersome.  I didn\\'t need a bigger car than an economy size since there was only 2 of us.  I understand that they probably work off of commission, but sometimes it\\'s unnecessary to try and convince you to get something that you don\\'t need.\\\\n\\\\nThe return process was pretty quick and easy as well.  I ended up getting charged for an extra day because I brought the car back 1.5 hours after the pick up time since my flight didn\\'t leave until 8 PM.  Too bad they don\\'t have a \\\\\"grace\\\\\" period for regular customers.\\\\n\\\\nOther than that the car was fine.

But when we got there, there was 2 completely empty tables in the front of the stage! The sales people were really unorganized to not notice that was available! So we ditched our booth and went straight to the front table, which gave a much better view.\\\\n\\\\nThe show was def entertaining, with finely sculpted men ripping off their shirts and dressing up in firemen/spartan outfits ;) The occasional view of g-strings was not as welcome, something about a man in a g-string is just wrong, you know? but nonetheless, it was very entertaining. The emcee\\'s accent was hot, and so was his bod. i think i found him the most attractive out of all the guys. They pulled a lot of the bachelorettes and birthday girls onstage to participate, and some of the older women too, which i thought was cool. They also ran around through the audience as well, so no matter where your seats were, I think you\\'d be able to get up close with one of the guys.\\\\n\\\\nDownside though, at the end of the show, you are welcome to go to the front of the stage and pay $20 PER PERSON to take a pic with the guys, only to receive one picture. no offense, but that is a total rip off. i\\'ve been to Fantasy, which is a female stripshow,  and you can take pics with them for free, and they had much better attitudes and were a lot friendlier to talk to after the show. They were annoyed that we had stood in like and decided against taking the picture after the show, and even more annoyed when a girl behind us asked if they took credit card. wtf?

An entire fish is evenly flayed open and nailed to a plank of hickory wood, it is usually sprinkled with a little olive oil and perhaps some tamarind paste, and is then placed in a 45-degree angle by a charcoal fire.  Traditionally, large freshwater fish are used, but at chateau, the fish of choice is Tilapia - which is quite good and I suspect the best method to prepare this dish.  The result is a charred surface of the fish but all of the juiciness trapped inside - delectable.  It is not very often that I get the pleasure of enjoying a nice Masgoof.\\\\n\\\\nIn most cases, I find kabob houses to be boring and that isn\\'t because I don\\'t love the almighty Kabob, it\\'s because I have come to expect that Kabob places outside of the Middle East, Detroit, and even Western Europe just can never get it right - every time there is hope, it normally ends in disappointment for me - I should have never made that trip to Iran in 2007 where I was in kabob paradise.  However, Chateau Kabob located in the Frankophilic metropolis of Montreal did me rare pleasure of maintaining that hope.  Here in Washington, DC we need to cling to places like Shamshiri and Alboorz to get our kabob fix but even that gets repetitive after a while - especially when there isn\\'t a single Kabob house in the region that can even hold a candle to those two places and therefor isn\\'t particularly incumbent of them to reach for the stars.  Chateau Kabob does it right and is about as close as you can get to some of the legendary places you can find in Iraq and Iran - the latter of which reigns supreme in the world of Kabobs.  At Chateau the spices are right, the juiciness is on par, and the meat is superb - all in all a very excellent Kabob.  And perhaps one of the most underappreciate techniques that Chateau also got right is the rice!  It is superb here - fluffy, velvety, and aromatic.\\\\n\\\\nThe interiors and d\\\\u00e9cor of Chateau are good which kind of surprised me at first as I\\'ve come to expect that most other Persian or Arab restaurants (as expected) sport some of the most gaudy and hideous interiors known to man.

A 9 table restaurant, intimate, contemporary but not stuffy decor, washrooms spotless, service friendly and on point. They truly want your dining experience to be a cut above the rest. They are attentive without being intrusive and the FOOD.... the gnocchi was suggested to us by a guest seated nearby who heard we were new to town. This selection was wonderful, pillowy dumpling puffs with lobster and truffle oil... I was sold! My husband and I shared this plate of deliciousness and the restaurant will split the plate for you in the kitchen, no problem. The fresh bread came with shallot butter - WOW, a must try, I love flavoured butters! For the main meal trio, I got the Dock Side which is a perfect scallop, perfect shrimp and the most tender, buttery fish filet once can ask for. My husband chose the meat option and he too could only describe his filet as \\\\\"butter\\\\\" and loved everything else that accompanied it. The small hot pots with the fresh veg inside in a butter broth were hits as well! The sparkling volcanic water was a nice change for us and the wine list was beyond impressive. We each had one glass, a red and white. MMMMM! Everything here is 100% Italian including the waiters and it was so nice to see how knowledgeable they are about the menu and passionate about what they serve! The chef obviously took a lot of pride in her work and created for us, THE perfect plates!\\\\nThe end of the meal sadly came and although we were stuffed, we chose to share the lemon curd with berries plate to cleanse the palate. The best choice we could of made - or was it?! We will have to find out next time we come! We enjoyed the location of Capo in Inglewood, quite central and the waiter who called a taxi for us even waited with us outside chatting with us until the cab came.

I wanted to take a look around, it was nicely decorated, but I could clearly see the person in charge slightly annoyed that I wanted to browse before buying.

In both instances the person who came to clean was on time and it was easy to get a hold of the company when I needed to. Also, they call around 15-30 minutes beforehand to let you know they are on the way. This is a great help since I had to drive 45 minutes to meet them so it was nice knowing how far they were. Their price was also quite good since I requested 4 rooms upstairs, hallway, stairs, and downstairs bedroom. Now the first experience I had was on 09/15. The person who came to clean was Mark. I was not satisfied at all with his work. He didn\\'t clean a good 2 inches from the walls around the whole perimeter of the house. The stairs looked worse than before he came. There were soo many stains that he said should come out that were still there and the carpet was extra crunchy after it dried. Any time we tried to mention something to him we would always get the same response that he\\'s been doing this for 28 or 30 years and wouldn\\'t really listen to our concern. In a normal situation that would warrant an instant 1 star review since I chose this company based on over 500 positive reviews and the pictures seemed great. The work I had gotten done on 09/15 was not anywhere near what the pictures looked like. However instead of rushing to yelp I figured this company doesn\\'t have 500 plus good reviews for nothing and called them up around 09/20. This is where I can really appreciate this company\\'s commitment to customers. When I called I believe the owner picked up. If I remember correctly his name was Rick. I told him everything that happened and he was very cooperative about the fact that I wasn\\'t satisfied at all with Mark\\'s work. He said he\\'ll send his right hand man Joe out and we were quickly able to schedule for 09/22. Again communication is very easy with this company. On top of that Rick told me the second visit wouldn\\'t be of charge. So Saturday comes and we get a phone call from Isaac saying he\\'s on his way, again great communication. I didn\\'t worry too much that it wasn\\'t Joe at our door like I was told since Isaac seemed like he knew what to do in these situations where the previous work wasn\\'t satisfactory. He let me show him where I wasn\\'t satisfied and could see where and why some of the stains didn\\'t come out and said he\\'ll go over all the areas. I was surprised since I thought he\\'d just go over the areas with spots only. But he went over everything all over again and everything looked A LOT better. The stairs actually looked like they had been cleaned this time and Isaac also went ahead and did the risers which I wasn\\'t expecting. There were some stains that wouldn\\'t come out but he had mentioned that to us. Overall his work actually resembled some of the yelp pictures and the carpets weren\\'t nearly as crunchy when dried after Isaac went over them. He also put the corner protectors on the wall which I appreciated (something Mark didn\\'t do). So my first experience was not good at all but the company was quick to help resolve the issue and reiterated how they wanted the customer to be happy and would do whatever they could to ensure that. This alone earns praise from me since it shows they care enough to at least try and make things better. Second experience with Isaac was WAY better and communication with the company is a breeze.

Beyond the (yes, I do realize it was intentional) misspelling of the name of the restaurant, Lucki Thai doesn\\'t miss on many marks for me.\\\\n\\\\nI\\'ve had the opportuniti to dine in, get carri out, and order deliveri (I\\'ll stop this now) from Lucki on many occasions in the last few months, so I can tell you that no matter which method you decide to go with for your thai food fix there you won\\'t be disappointed.  The first time I had Lucki I dined in and had the Tom Yum soup with Shrimp and their Crab Fried rice.  The Tom Yum Soup is consistently good, and I\\'d know since it\\'s been a staple of every single order I\\'ve made with Lucki since.  It\\'s always hot, with the perfect combination of sour and spicy, and loaded with mushrooms and an ample amount of shrimp.  The large order feeds 2 perfectly.  The crab fried rice is not something I tend to order, but Lucki\\'s version definitely packed a lot of crab flavor.   They also weren\\'t shy with the egg on the rice, and being an egg slut like Anthony Bourdain, that pleased me.\\\\n\\\\nI\\'ve done a mix of delivery and take-out many times since, and every time the delivery is at the house by the promised time (usually well before), and the food has almost always been ready to go when I arrive for a carry-out order.  \\\\n\\\\nOf the items I\\'ve ordered those times, the curries have been phenomenal, as has the spicy eggplant entree.   I wish I could explain what makes the eggplant there stand out over other places that I\\'ve had similar dishes, but I usually gobble it up so fast there\\'s no time for me to remember any particulars about the dish other than it\\'s absolutely delectable.  I\\'m also a huge fan of their brown rice option, even though it\\'s $2 extra.   Lucki\\'s brown rice is one of the only in the city that I feel is worth whatever upcharge they want for it.   I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s not just brown rice but a mix of wild and brown rice.   I also really liked the Rad Na, though my laziness knows no bounds in that I felt like it was a lot of work eating it.   It\\'s truly shameful.   \\\\n\\\\nThe only order I wasn\\'t completely thrilled with so far was the Beef Pad See Ewe.  The flavors were nice, but the beef was tough and chewy.   A simple misstep which I can forgive.\\\\n\\\\nI have to admit I almost gave 4 stars instead of 5 for the only thing that has gotten on my nerves a bit with Lucki Thai thus far:   spice consistency.   I started by ordering level 6 and 7 which is my normal go-to at other Thai joints, but didn\\'t find them spicy enough.   I\\'ve now settled on an 8, which at most places would feel like it was burning a hole in my esophagus with each swallow.   Getting delivery a few weeks ago and ordering an 8, it had literally ZERO spice.  It actually might have gotten into the negatives.   It\\'s quite frustrating because I suspect if I move into the 9-10 category the chef stops even paying attention and probably just dumps a whole barrel of ghost chiles into the pan.   WHAT\\'S MY NEXT MOVE HERE?\\\\n\\\\nBut alas, the service and food are simply too good even with that inconsistenci.  Sorry I couldn\\'t resist.\", \"date\": \"2015-10-17 00:21:53\"}\\n',\n",

I enjoyed my appointments with Dr. Strain and found her to be knowledgable and attentive. However, I was incredibly displeased with how I was treated by the staff. I went through my vision insurance with a staff member and assumed this information was added to my file. I called a month or so later to order contacts and was told I could not pay for the contacts when I came and picked them up; I needed to pay for them over the phone. I have never paid for contacts before picking them up before but I figured it wasn\\'t a big deal, just differences between offices. Once I got the statement for my order, I realized that they had charged me the full amount and not run anything through my insurance company. I called back and was met with no answers, saying they would call me back later. They never did, so I called back again and finally learned that my vision insurance had never been added to my file. After going through my information a second time, they then assured me they would file a claim with my insurance company and I would receive a check soon. Never once in this back and forth did anyone from the staff apologize or recognize that they had made a mistake. In fact, everyone I talked to seemed more agitated that they now had to reprocess the claim. A month later, I received my refund along with an updated billing statement. Amongst the revised patient/insurance payment was a statement describing why the revision was necessary. It read: \\\\\"patient originally did not say to use insurance and paid in full for contacts-decided a few days later she would like us to bill vsp and refund her the remaining balance\\\\\". This is the first medical establishment I have come in contact with that required me to advise them of my desire to use my medical insurance.

The facility is clean, but what makes the difference for me is the fact that the staff there was so friendly, and welcoming. All of the technicians were talking with the clients and there were even a few friendly group conversations between everyone in the salon. It was very comfortable! Most of the ladies in there during my appointment were regular clients and they had nothing but good things to say about the place after learning that it was my first time there. Loyal clientele is always a good sign. \\\\nJohnny did my acrylic nails (full set) which I am totally in love with.

We saw this beautiful white 3 tiered pyramid shaped cake in a then really big Julia Robert\\'s movie and really wanted that one. We went in to Baker Wee to see if they could make it. The owners were not there and we were told by the manager lady we spoke to that she will be the one making the cake anyway. She saw the movie too and knew exactly what cake we were asking for. We even made a 2D drawing of it, she wrote down her notes and took the order. She said she will rent the movie so she can take one more look at it before she makes it. Fast forward to our wedding day....we arrived at the restaurant where our dinner reception was and for the first time we got to see our cake. WOW! We almost fainted. I should include pictures because there\\'s just no way to describe how ugly it was. The original agreement in size was a 12\\\\\" x 12\\\\\" square and 10-12\\\\\" tall, like I said pyramid. We got an 8\\\\\" square base, next layer 6\\\\\" base and the top layer 4\\\\\" base and the whole cake was 2 feet tall! It looked like a Chinese pagoda. The layers were on 4\\\\\" tall sticks. And the best part: it was airbrushed with brown color like marble and had brown 1/2\\\\\" diameter ball on the top.. -   Turned out, the owner (who has never seen the movie - or apparently a pyramid before ) ended up making the cake, never called us or the manager lady with questions, just tried to figure it out from the her notes. This was her understanding of it.  We were so embarrassed all night, everyone kept asking what the cake was supposed to be? We just kept saying: a snow white pyramid. Next morning we drove down to the bakery, furious. She said she will not refund the $300 we spent on it because she worked on it all day and she did her best. She said she was sorry and we can have a basic cake ($30 value) for free. We did get that cake a few week later for a birthday and never ever returned to Baker Wee again. It\\'s very sad how greatly it impacted our special day. We should have demanded a refund but we gave up on the arguing back and fourth - it didn\\'t change anything. After all we didn\\'t want the money, we wanted the cake. So anyway, I would not recommend them if they were the last bakery, I  would rather make a homemade cake.

Definitely not one of the top dishes of the night but was still yummy.  The ASPARAGUS however, was QUITE delicious!! they probably cooked it in butter... hahaha i\\'ll take it :) A good bite on the outside and nice and tender on the inside! \\\\n- Sea Bass with oversized Peruvian corn!!! YUMMMY!!!! The sea bass was nice and flaky.  Flavoring was a bit salty but I feel like at these restaurants they tend to do that a bit...i mean, everyones a bit intoxicated so salty foods are what people want LOL The peruvian corn was just really fun to eat!! My friends really enjoyed it but I definitely like summer sweet white corn on the cob better :) \\\\n- MUSHROOM POT ON CRACK. THIS WAS DEFINITELY THE SHOW STOPPER OF THE NIGHT!!! the flavoring of the sauce, the textures of the 3? 4? different mushrooms. happiness. The sauce was like a cream of mushroom, milky, full flavored, salty, a hint of sweetness... too good. needless to say we all took a bite and just smiled in satisfaction. We all stared at each other and knew rice was needed to soak up all that bomb sauce!! \\\\n- 4 different Sushi Rolls were brought out last (3.5 stars).  All 4 were decent, nothing really to rave much about unfortunately. :(  I\\'m a big big sushi lover and have had some off the chart rolls so I can\\'t pretend these were anything to die for.  \\\\n\\\\n***The first time I came my friend ordered for the table and I definitely think that made a difference.  They have some REALLY scrumptious dishes that I wish I could\\'ve ordered for my friends to try!! Perhaps next time!! I\\'ll be more prepared lol \\\\n\\\\nOVERALL RATINGS:\\\\nFood - 3.75 stars (except for the mushroom pot on crack... 4.5 stars for that)\\\\nFood (for the first time I came) - 4.25 stars! \\\\nDrink - 4 stars for the cucumber cocktail & bottle of Santa Margaritta Pino Grigio\\\\nPresentation - 4 stars\\\\nService & Ambiance - 4 stars\\\\n\\\\nI gave this place 4 stars mainly because I had a great time that night, and the company I kept definitely played a big part in that.  The food IS goood, just a bit $$$$.  Its definitely a GREAT place to go with a group thats just looking for some good eats, good drinks, and a great time :O) BOTTOM LINE: I\\'d DEFINITELY GO BACK AGAIN!!\", \"date\": \"2012-02-21 20:10:36\"}\\n',\n",

The overall concept is quite fun - as an activity alone, we would rate this 5 stars - it is REALLY fun and something you can imagine yourself doing over and over as a social event.  Why two stars, you ask?\\\\n\\\\nThere are major issues with this place that test your patience.  First off, when you walk in, its total pandemonium (we came here at 3pm on Friday).  There are two line queue\\'s but no signage or help as to what the lines are for, or where to even stand in line.  As it turns out, the first line is the \\\\\"membership line\\\\\" - everyone needs a $5 membership.  \\\\n\\\\nThe second line, is to \\\\\"check in\\\\\" - by which they scan your new membership card and ask whether you want a bay on a specific floor.  \\\\n\\\\nBoth of those tasks sound SO easy - and they should be - yet we still waited in line for about 40 minutes to accomplish these two tasks.  The entire time, we and everyone else in line are talking about how inefficient this place is and you would think the managers would see this once, and rearrange things to make it easier.  After all, we really wanted a beer - we could have been through two rounds at the bar in the same amount of  time we spent waiting around to check in.  \\\\n\\\\nAfter all that, we still went to the bar and had two rounds while we waited.  Good selection of beer, bartenders were fast to see that we wanted booze and wasted no time in getting it.  \\\\n\\\\nThen, we get our text message - our bay is ready, requiring us to go muscle into the line and tell the check in staff we are ready (which then irritates everyone in line because you are obviously butting in), but thats the way they like it here I guess.  \\\\n\\\\nWe head to our bay with a \\\\\"bay concierge\\\\\" that gives us the down low on the mechanics of play.  Its not the most intuitive thing in the world, but it works.  \\\\n\\\\nWe start hitting balls and our waiter shows up.  He literally walks us through the entire menu, page by page, explaining burgers, and appetizers, and frozen margaritas like we had never been to a pub before and didn\\'t know what a \\\\\"slider\\\\\" was.  (Mind you, you pay by the hour at this place, so someone taking your time is quite annoying).  We order a bucket of beer and chips and guac, and shoo him off and get back to our golf.  Beers arrive, chips arrive - and our waiter arrives..... and stays.... and gets all chatty about football and where my family is from, and his Grandma in Colorado, and what it was like working after Christmas, and all sorts of topics that none of us care to talk about.  ugh, leave us alone - we are here for golf and beer, not a new pal.\\\\n\\\\nWhen the chips came out, one in my party leaned over to the server and said, \\\\\"do you know one thing thats missing in this place?\\\\\"  The server leaned in all interested.... \\\\\"napkins - there are no napkins on the table\\\\\".  Our server launched into a story about why there are no napkins - another server spilled a huge tray of soda into a bussing cart and that knocked over someones golf bag, and on and on and on..... and no napkins.  He stopped talking and stared at us - and we asked him, \\\\\"could we have napkins?\\\\\" - and there was this \\'oh yeah\\' moment - he was oblivious at times.\\\\n\\\\nSo, we shoo waiter off to get another bucket of beer and a refill of chips, and he comes back with the beer, and no chips (and again, all chatty - does this guy have other tables?).  The refill of chips took about 20 minutes.  We came at an odd time, and we were expected home for dinner, but the burgers and sandwiches on other tables looked very good.\\\\n\\\\nThe kicker though, was that near the end of our session, our new buddy server out of the blue told us that the day after Christmas, there was a five hour wait, and they ran out of food, and booze, and kegs, etc.  He told us that they were going to get a lot of negative reviews for that on an email service card that is sent to you the next day after playing.  He asked us if we wouldn\\'t mind marking everything 5 stars because they really needed the good marks, and he would buy us desert if we said yes.  \\\\n\\\\nOK, this is the business guy in me coming out now, but the whole reason for getting feedback from your customers is to IMPROVE and figure out where you are failing.  The fact that you have a 40 minute check in process, or that you ran out of beer one night, or that there are no napkins on the table, or that there seems to be tons of staff walking around but not helping the bottlenecks - these are ALL issues that management needs to be aware of - but instead, they try to bribe you so that you will rate them the way they want to be rated.  If I owned this place, I would be PISSED off.   \\\\n\\\\nAgain, its a really fun concept, but it will try on your nerves big time.\", \"date\": \"2015-01-03 21:34:24\"}\\n',\n",

When our  meals came out they served him ravioli, he was told by the server they found some ravioli in the back- um okay, would have been nice to know before he got his meal as he was already looking forward to eating the dish he thought he ordered.  He was served a 2 mushroom ravioli and 1 ricotta (which he said was much better than the mushroom). \\\\nI was told by my friends that the chicken Marsala and chicken pot pie were good.

Best bet is to park in the parking garage and then go to the walking mall.  Even so, it\\'s tough to find.  Don\\'t give up.  Also, it is no longer Fuego Tacos, but now Fuego del Mar, with a seafood-centric menu.  \\\\n\\\\nThat being said.  I was pretty edgy by the time we arrived.  We\\'re from Cave Creek and had been out shopping and then had a heck of a time finding the place, so we arrived about 8.15---pretty close to closing.  And I had a Groupon---and there are Yelp reviews that said the staff DOESN\\'T like Groupon-ers.\\\\n\\\\nGreeted by guy that I assume is the gent someone described as \\\\\"XL\\\\\".  He\\'s just a little round.  And was a warm, welcoming fella.  He beamed a smile at us, waved at dining room and told us to sit wherever we wanted.  We chose a cozy booth in the corner.  Our server was there in moments with menus and take our drink orders.  I wish I remembered her name---dark hair in a pony-tail, glasses, and really personable and nice despite it being the end of the night and we were late-comers.  \\\\n\\\\nNice ambiance---exposed brick walls, soft light, great music---DH would have liked their playlist!\\\\n\\\\nTROUBLE: she hands us the menu.  Except for one dish, everything is seafood.  Fuego Tacos is now Fuego del Mar.  DH doesn\\'t like fish and is semi-allergic to shellfish.  I asked if he wanted to leave, and he said no, we had gone thru too much to find the place---he would just order the one non-seafood dish.  At least he didn\\'t have to make a lot of choices!  So DH ordered the Pernil Asada, which was described as slow-cooked pork topped with mango-chile salsa.  His sides were the Green Chile-Bacon Hushpuppies and the Latin Succotash.  I ordered their signature dish of Seafood Chile Rellenos---a poblano pepper stuffed with shrimp, crab and tilapia in a lobster-tomato sauce with hush puppies and Pineapple-Serrano Cole Slaw.  For drinks, DH got the house red and I got a Pomegranate Adult Lemonade.\\\\n\\\\nDrinks arrived in less than 5 minutes.  DH very happy with something he thought would be bottom row plonk.  My Adult Lemonade was SO delicious---I had to be careful!  I could have drank several of them.  It tasted like lemonade with a hint of fruit---but it definitely had alcohol in it!\\\\n\\\\nEntrees arrived within 15 minutes of the drinks.  DH\\'s was all on one plate.  Three hush puppies, Latin Succotash---which looked delish---and a mound of pork with the salsa.  Not super pretty.  My presentation was much more beautiful---a mammoth poblano pepper in a puddle of light red sauce.  Slaw and hush puppies on the side.  Lovely presentation.  My only comment is that serving something in a bowl (albeit large) that needs to be cut is problematic.\\\\n\\\\nI\\'d like to say how wonderful DH\\'s meal was, but basically I got one bite of his pork---that\\'s all he would share---before he devoured it.  He said it was one of the best pork dishes he had ever enjoyed.  He felt like he was in the Caribbean!  I got no bites of the Succotash, darn him---looked so good!  He scarfed it all!   His hush puppies went that fast too!\\\\n\\\\nWas my seafood Chile Relleno the best thing EVER?  No, but it was VERY, VERY GOOD!  Beautifully cooked, not greasy,  seafood not overcooked at all, the lobster-tomato sauce was delicious.  Again, only quibble I have is serving it in a bowl.  It was a very deep bowl too---a smaller girl might have had trouble reaching in there, but I am fairly tall and long-armed.  The hush puppies---shut my mouth, darlin\\', but they were dang good!  Lots of lovely, bacon-y flavor, a hint of heat, and a touch sweet.  What is it with those Yankees not adding a bit of sweet to their cornbread?  Whoever made these knew what they were doing.  The Pineapple-Serrano Cole Slaw was in a citrus-y, non-creamy dressing and the crispness, the fruitiness and the heat was a perfect counterpoint to the richness of the Relleno.\\\\n\\\\nHuge portion---I ended up bringing home half the Relleno, Slaw and two hush puppies---LUNCH!  YUM!  DH swined his plate so it\\'s deli turkey for him, hahaha!\\\\n\\\\nBonus---ended up talking to the gentleman in the booth next to us---so interesting.  He is a musician who\\'s lived all over the US and the world---Europe and the Middle East.  Really neat guy.  I wouldn\\'t live in the City, but I love visiting the City \\'cause you meet the most interesting people!\\\\n\\\\nSo at the end, I pulled out my Groupon and gave it to our server, apologizing that I had \\\\\"hid\\\\\" it until the end, but that Yelp reviews had indicated Groupon-ers got short shift as far as service went.  She took it graciously with a smile and said one of the issues was when they were Fuego Tacos, people ordered $9 plates than proferred a $10 Groupon.  Not nice.

Getting to the club was simple, took only around 15 minutes from the car to the lines (and that included a bit of pre-gaming)! \\\\n\\\\nEntry: Got my entire group on a guestlist with a 1:1 (guy/girl) comp until midnight. Sign up on their website and you will get a text back if you have been put on. The entry line was confusing as hell, with at least 4 different lines (staff, promoter, general, VIP). There was an open bar for ladies from 11-12 so things were a bit rushed. This came back to bite me in the ass as I made the mistake of leaving my guestlist line for the shorter staff entry line. Members of my group were with this female staff member who said could get us all free in even though our guy:girl ratio had more guys. I spoke with her personally to make sure of it before I left my line. Well...SHE LIED! The bouncers upfront simply took the first equal ratio of guys:girls, leaving me and another guy stuck paying $40 entry. My girlfriend was not pleased with the fact that one of my other group members (who came stag) got in for free and I didn\\'t. Whatever, lesson learned. Don\\'t rush in. Don\\'t be tempted by an open bar or a shorter line. Stick with guestlist if you\\'re approved. Make sure your group ratio is even or favors girls. Don\\'t listen to otherwise!\\\\n\\\\nClub Layout: The club itself is very nice. Not quite as grand or spacious as XS next door, but a beautiful venue nonetheless. Main dance floor is average sized. It was spacious enough so that we didn\\'t feel like canned sardines and had adequate room to dance. There are no stairs or steps to climb, a la Marquee, so ladies will appreciate this. The main room is flanked by a large tent-like area and the outdoor wading pool/patio area. The easiest accessible restrooms are outside as well (the indoor one gets crowded). The outdoor area is ideal for those who want to socialize more, take pictures, take a breather, etc. It\\'s beautiful.\\\\n\\\\nBar: The indoor bar layout is terrible. There was maybe 10 feet between the bar and the backs of the booths for those who got tables. This 10 feet also serves as the main walkway to get to the tent and outdoor area. Not so surprisingly, there is a lot of pushing, bouncers shining lights and telling you to move, and it worst of all: it takes forever to get a drink! I said before to not by tempted by an open bar for ladies and here\\'s why: this is the only bar ladies can get free drinks from! On top of that, ladies can only get one drink at a time! So ladies, if you planned to be here for an hour and get drunk or pass drinks to the guys, you\\'ll be disappointed.The outdoor bar nudged in between the tent/outdoor area is empty and stress-free compared to the one inside, so I would recommend buying drinks from here. Drinks were typical Vegas prices so expect in the neighborhood of $15 per.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, I had a great experience at Surrender. The club was beautiful, my group had a blast, and Morgan Page (and his opener) rocked it! Learn from my mistake, stay away from the indoor bar, and come with great people and you will have one memorable night! 4/5.\", \"date\": \"2012-12-04 07:49:34\"}\\n',\n",

So getting my glasses took over two months.\\\\n\\\\nFor my hard lens it took time to get that correct as well, but that is expected. It also took me several times asking my Oakland optometrist to get my records faxed to them. McCauley-Celin at first said they never received them, but they then found them in another computer system. When the first lens didn\\'t fit quite right I went to the Wexford office to get it checked and left my lens there as it needed to be returned.

I paid for my lens with my FSA account but then was told that it should be covered under my insurance and that they would take care of it. That didn\\'t happen so I called to ask about it. They never got back to me so I went to their Gibsonia office and they said that they owed me money and it was fixed.

We ate there, while letting the sunscreen dry, then spent the whole afternoon dancing and splashing. The staff was great, the people as well-  there was hard partying but no fights or any such ratchetness, just people from all over having the time of our lives. The rave-booty was twerk-tacular. There were spankings. The bartenders seemed to be having more fun than the people drinking. All I saw were smiles.

We danced with our group of 8 (4 couples) and met plenty of nice people. \\\\n\\\\nAs more of my group came in from all over, we came back for Marshmello Saturday night (Nightswim!), whom I hadn\\'t seen since EDC last year. We got a great table on a lily-pad off the pool (not on the pool) just in case there was gratuitous splashing, we\\'d want a dry drinking spot haha. Our view was fantastic, table was perfect, the VIP even invited us into the small VIP pool behind us. \\\\n\\\\nWe got a great package that started with 2 magnums of grey goose, which did great for our group.

In front of the counter, it\\'s essentially a small independent convenience store with many of the things you\\'d expect.  Candy bars, meds, condiments, snacks, microwavable items, beer, wine, soda, as well as odds and ends like tissue paper, shampoo, and storage bags.  I can well imagine some Downtown college students living in the apartments upstairs too hung over or too tired to drive two miles to Safeway and instead opting for a stop here.\\\\n\\\\nFor my first stop here on a Saturday morning, I opted to get a quick morning pick me up.  A tea and a sandwich.  I got their Salted Caramel Iced Tea (also available hot) and their Turkey Sausage Egg & Cheese sandwich on an english muffin.  Both made to order.  Total cost including tax: $10.  Now to be fair, they prepared the sandwich in part using a microwave so we\\'re not talking gourmet here.  Still, the sandwich hit the spot and the sausage in particular was very tasty.  I was also very happy with the tea.  Almost tasted like a southern style sweet tea of sorts with those caramel accents.  A solid breakfast.\\\\n\\\\nSo there you have it.  A locally owned business filling a need in an emerging neighborhood.  Nothing pretentious.  Just a good, straight forward, progressive independent convenience store.  Even if you don\\'t live in this quiet corner of Downtown, its worth a look.  Or a sip and bite and it was in my case.\", \"date\": \"2018-09-01 17:56:05\"}\\n',\n",

The facility is clean and well equipped and the staff is knowledgeable and full of personality. When my wife and I first showed up, we had a deal to try five sessions for 99 dollars. We had talked for a while about joining a gym, but fitness together is so much more. It\\'s like a community of people working toward a common goal of getting fit and taking control of their health. The owner, Joe, is very knowledgeable in fitness, exercise, and most importantly nutrition. He worked with us to set up individual  nutrition plans and exercise programs to help us attain our goals. Included with your sessions purchase is a fitness assessment which measures body fat percentage, fitness levels, resting heart rate, flexibility, and a few other factors. Additional assessments are given throughout your tenure as a fitness together member so you can watch your total body transformation. It is a very encouraging atmosphere no matter your current level of fitness. At first I dreaded going to exercise, but after seeing the positive changes you just can\\'t wait to get back. I like the fact that sessions can be purchased in packages without a long term commitment, but I must say I continue to add additional sessions. This is mainly because I continue to see results. My wife and I are both stronger, healthier, and happier thanks to Joe and his knowledgeable and helpful staff. I highly recommend Fitness Together to anyone looking to get into shape, tone up, lose some inches or lbs. it\\'s been a great experience.\", \"date\": \"2013-04-10 17:15:32\"}\\n',\n",

I like the atmosphere of the restaurant and that they have a little pseudo patio as well.  It was nice sitting out there and people watching all of the crazy people who come through the Forum Shops.  Our server was very friendly, but did seem a little awkward and didn\\'t make a lot of eye contact.  His recommendations were spot on and we enjoyed all of our food.  I over heard other servers asking tables where they were from, and it was a little overboard.  EVERY person who came to a table asked that question.  The poor table next to us must\\'ve answered 15 times.  Here is a little tip: if the hostess asks, she should then communicate it to the server. So when the server approaches the table he/she can say \\\\\"hey, I heard you are visiting from ____, welcome!\\\\\" Much more personal.\\\\n\\\\nAnyhow, on to the food!!\\\\n\\\\nWe started out sharing the french onion soup, a caesar salad and the tater tots.  All were delicious.  The croutons were homemade on the salad and very flavorful.  The soup was served in a litte crock and was very cheesy.  The tater tots were not my favorite in town, but they are still good.  They are homemade and served with tomato jelly instead of ketchup.\\\\n\\\\nMain Course:  I had the delmonico ribeye, oscar style.  The steak was done perfectly and the crab meat and bernaise were amazing.  I could barely eat 1/2 of my meat!  My guest had the lobster mac n\\' cheese, which is very different, but very delicious.  There was plenty of lobster meat and it was a large portion.  There was spinach, mushrooms and other things mixed in, which is different.\\\\n\\\\nWe had a side of asparagus, which was amazing.  Cooked perfectly al dente.  We also had the \\\\\"canon\\\\\" potato on the side, upon recommenation from our server.  I am SO glad I tried this.  It is actually an English food called \\\\\"bubble and squeak.\\\\\" Mashed potatoes are sauteed with bacon and chopped cabbage and then topped with a cheese sauce.  Sounds strange, but it was a great combination!  I would go back for that dish alone.\\\\n\\\\nFor dessert we shared the fresh apple cobbler topped with cinammon ice cream.  It was warm and delicious, like an apple pie fresh out of the oven.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, I love the place.  They have a raw bar that often has happy hour specials for $1 oysters.

I chose them over several other companies because they are honest, hard-working individuals who operate their business with integrity and professionalism.  They manage my property so well I never have to worry about the details.  And as an out-of-state property owner, I don\\'t want to worry and have extra hassles!  They take care of everything, every step of the way.  Their communications are clear, concise, timely, and professional.  I will never switch and go to another company because I am so convinced I am getting honest and impeccable service from Active Renter, at a very reasonable cost.\\\\n\\\\nAs for the tenants who are complaining, I am hard-pressed to believe that Rich and the entire Active Renter crew have treated anyone poorly or have not serviced rentals in a timely manner. There are also people who tear up property (not their property!!) and then complain when they get billed for all the damages.  These are probably the same tenants who punch holes in dry wall, steal furnaces (who DOES that!?!?!?!), damage landscaping, tear up concrete driveways, etc.  - and then later complain when they are held accountable for the damages they created.  It\\'s said that people who have negative comments are much more likely to post a review than people with positive comments - on a 9 to 1 basis!  So for every complaint, remember there are dozens, hundreds, perhaps even thousands of individuals who have wonderfully positive things to say about Active Renter, but just don\\'t take the time to post a review.\\\\n\\\\nFrom either the property management or the leasing side, I don\\'t think you\\'ll get better service anywhere than Active Renter provides.  I would recommend them - WITHOUT RESERVATION - to any family member, friend, and/or colleague.

They seem so much more professional. When our shakes were delivered to the table the chocolate shake made it to the table but the strawberry banana shake was poured into my wifes lap.

My wife received a borage of \\\\\"I\\'m sorry!\\\\\"s which is awesome and conveys how the workers were feeling at the time. The most important question or worry during this situation is #1 How does the customer feel? #2 How can we help them? #3 What can we do to rectify the situation? In retrospect all we received was late food, apologies, wet pants, napkins, and a bill to pay for it all. Yes a bill! The manager came over attempting to offer apologies and a mop.

My arms never looked better...I was sincerely a beautiful bride...at age 43 I looked better at this wedding than my 1st one! \\\\n\\\\nWhen we first started looking at gyms we were struggling with how to fit in everything we were looking for in a gym...times of classes, co-ed so we both could attend, small enough for personalized attention, motivating enough to keep us coming back and fun...we hate working out, so if we were going to avoid going out for drinks and dinner we needed some SERIOUS motivation.\\\\n\\\\nThe group training is co-ed, the classes are offered at the perfect times for our schedule, the gym is near our home and the owner, Bobby, is crazy funny and terribly motivating - he keeps us going!\\\\n\\\\nBUT....I really knew that Results Only fit our family and our lifestyle when Bobby introduced his TEEN fitness program to my son! Bobby was an instant hit with my Pre-Teen and now he is eagerly getting in shape and learning about fitness, gaining confidence and having fun at Results Only. We are hooked. I can\\'t imagine where we would find a gym like this and I have tried quite a few gyms in the valley - and have great things to say about many of them - but Bobby has offered us the MOST for our family and delivered the highest level of results. \\\\n\\\\nThanks Bobby...from all of us! I can\\'t wait to see what we look like on our wedding anniversary!\", \"date\": \"2010-08-21 06:53:33\"}\\n',\n",

After that, I began coming here for my morning cardio (walk/run/hike) several days a week. \\\\n\\\\nI agree with many of the reviews for this park. It has a little bit of everything and more. \\\\n\\\\n- A bad ass playground I wish existed during my childhood. \\\\n\\\\n- A huge grassy area for picnics, soccer, and just laying out to relax, read a good book, write or draw. I\\'ve seen some photographers do their photo sessions here. \\\\n\\\\n- There is a path way to a small mountain, great for a short hike. \\\\n\\\\n   It\\'s a great hike if you want to do a solo hike in the morning. Every morning that I\\'ve been here there were others hiking the trail, doing their morning cardio/workouts as well. So I felt safe knowing that there were others around if I accidentally fell or what not. \\\\n\\\\n- There is no cement trail up and down the mountain.  It\\'s just dirt and gravel. So be careful.\\\\n\\\\n- There are different pathways up and down the hill for the adventurous souls. (Not recommended for beginners. Check out the trail first before you go exploring :-) ) \\\\n\\\\n- There are two levels up the mountain. So you can rest at the 1st level. It has a shaded picnic table and a great view of the city. \\\\n\\\\n- At the top, there\\'s a huge platform with an amazing view of the city. With a little bit of Nevada history. It\\'s peaceful at the top. And reminds me why I love nature and this city. \\\\n\\\\n- Some people do their Tai Chi and/or meditation in the morning. Either at the top of the mountain or in the park.  It\\'s peaceful to watch. \\\\n\\\\n- There\\'s a small cement stage at the other end of the park. I\\'m guessing for plays and performances during the warmer months. \\\\n\\\\n- Bathrooms are clean and stocked every morning. \\\\n\\\\n- Great park to bring your doggies and fur buddies as well. \\\\n\\\\n*** Tip: If you don\\'t live in Mountain\\'s Edge & you\\'re coming from I-15/Blue Diamond or 215/Buffalo, it\\'s on Buffalo road & you\\'ll have to make a U-turn to get to the entrance of this park.\", \"date\": \"2016-01-17 06:00:36\"}\\n',\n",

I think they could make this into a pretty solid little restaurant if they fix some problems.\\\\nThe drinks are tasty, but very very heavy on the ice. They are charging drink prices comparable to Boltini down the street, which actually gives you a full glass instead of all this padding. We felt a bit ripped off. I also wish that the specialty cocktail selection had some not-sweet cocktails.\\\\nOne of us got a taco plate and the other got a torta plate. On both, the sides left a lot to be desired. I\\'m pretty sure our beans and rice were out of a can, and the potato wedges were fresh out of the freezer... The tacos themselves (1 shrimp, 1 fish) were pretty good, though! Only complaint is that they didn\\'t double up on the tortillas, so one of mine fell apart a bit. The steak torta was pretty good, although it would have done well with some pickled chiles. \\\\nI am somewhat annoyed that they don\\'t provide free chips with dinner. The entree size isn\\'t that big, which would have been fine if we got chips, but we left feeling hungry.\\\\nAnother rather big oversight is not providing some sort of spicy table salsa. The food wasn\\'t very spicy in itself. Any good Mexican restaurant should have some house salsas.\\\\n\\\\nI think the main problem here is cutting corners in really obvious ways: drinks loaded to brim with ice, no chips, no table salsa, sides are low quality afterthoughts. Even the lack of the doubled up tortilla. Come on guys, tortillas are not expensive. You can afford to give me 4 instead of 2 with my $8 entree.\\\\n\\\\nAnother weird thing that was noted by all my dining companions: Pretty much every Mexican joint in the town has Mexican people working the back AND the front of the house, including several restaurants owned by this very same family. Here, the front of house waitstaff is exclusively white skinny blond ladies. That has to be a conscious decision.

It was the midafternoon, so the atmosphere was subdued. Some may refer to this place as a \\\\\"hole in the wall,\\\\\" but the antiquated interior was much more conducive for large groups than their former location not too far away. During our visit, the green-colored d\\\\u00e9cor included a large mural, blue-checkered floors, TVs, and three rows of tables stretched across the dining area.\\\\n\\\\nSanti and I started with the Ceviche de Pescado ($12.95) that came with slices of tilapia stacked and marinated in lime juice, spices, lettuce, yam, red onions, and Peruvian corn. The tilapia was fresh, nicely seasoned with lime juice without it being too overpowering. The spices were nicely embedded, and accompanied well when eaten with the sharp onions and sweet lettuce. The Peruvian corn and yam were delicious too. At first I was concerned about the portion size, but the fish turned out plentiful and worthwhile. \\\\n\\\\nWe then shared Pollo Saltado ($11.95) made with chunks of chicken saut\\\\u00e9ed with chopped tomatoes, french fries, red onions, cilantro, mignonette and soy sauce, and a side of steamed rice. The profile of the sauce was on point to bolster the flavors of the chicken. The red onions and tomatoes also nicely contributed to the profile of this dish. The fries were tasty, fried to perfection, and I was glad the cuts were on the thicker side to soak up the sweet-savory flavors. I only wished the fries were cooked down a little more with the onions and tomatoes. It met my expectations.\\\\n\\\\nThe Seco de Res ($13.95) was made with stewed beef loin in cilantro sauce, green peas, and served with fried yucca, salsa criolla, and Peruano beans. The beef was very nicely seasoned with wine and other spices. It was nicely stewed, tender, but also had lots of dry spots. The use of green peas gave a nice sweet dimension to this dish. The salsa criolla and fried yucca also have some textures and sharp bites to the refined beef loins. We both loved the Peruano beans. It was nicely cooked down, subtly sweet, and flavorful. \\\\n\\\\nWe were also given a side of roasted Peruvian corn with aji sauce. The sauce appeared more like a chunky salsa than the creamy smooth type I usually find in restaurants. \\\\n\\\\nThe flavors were far-reaching, but there were a number of limitations worth noting. First, unlike most Peruvian restaurants, Tumi does not offer fresh bread as a starter for the meal. Secondly, service was friendly and courteous throughout the meal. But, for whatever reason the server personally wrote the tip into our bill before delivery it to our table, an act I find unusual, offensive, and disrespectful. Ironically, we were going to give her a bigger tip until this happened.\\\\n\\\\nThe server did however, give us two coupons for $10 off each time we return to order at least $15 worth of food. Given the nice gesture, I was willing to give her some benefit of the doubt, but it still negatively influenced my rating of the experience.\\\\n\\\\nInterested diners should know that Yelp currently has a $10 for $20 deal at one voucher per table.

It was just one little nibble, but it was an insane burst of flavor.  While we were enjoying our wine and appetizer, the bread server came around with a selection of four different kinds of bread.  Instead of an individual table serving being brought to your table, a server comes with a large basket and serves you a few pieces of your choosing, plus olive oil for dipping.  I don\\'t know why, but I love this little unique aspect of this restaurant.\\\\n\\\\nFor the larger appetizer (oh yes, two appetizers), we each got the jumbo lump crab and avocado plate.  This was gigantic - we could have easily split one between the two of us.  The crab pieces were huge, easily the size of garlic bulbs.  My only suggestion for this would be to have a few pieces of the crostini instead of just a little sliver at the bottom.  The actual plate was quite juicy, and the crunch of the crostini was a good balance.  Mmm, this was like crab guacamole, so in other words, amazing.\\\\n\\\\nMy husband and I each got different salads.  He opted for the fois gras salad (which he loved, even though I was a bit too squeamish to sample it), and I got what I shall refer to as the pile \\'o beets.  Anyone who knows me knows my love affair with beets, and this was just perfect.  Slices of beets interspersed with goat cheese and well-seasoned... wish I could eat that every day.  Not very \\'salad-y\\' but heavenly nonetheless.\\\\n\\\\nThere were five different options for entrees, but we both had our eye on only one thing: the filet mignon.  Oh. My. Word.  This steak was cooked to perfection - so tender and juicy that my mouth is watering just remembering it!  It came with garlicky whipped potatoes and broccolini (which I delicately pushed to the side - sorry broccoli, we\\'re never going to be friends).  The portion was huge, and I had the second half wrapped up for lunch the next day.\\\\n\\\\nWe were nearly too full for dessert, but had to make room to try the chocolate ravioli.  It\\'s a little weird, and the texture is a bit chewier than I would have thought, but the flavor was excellent.  It came with a nice blend of raspberry and vanilla sauce for dipping, and was perfect alongside a steaming cup of coffee.\\\\n\\\\nAll in all, we had another excellent experience.  Barb even offered to keep my leftovers in the fridge until after the midnight festivities, but I was afraid I\\'d forget in the massive crowd leaving downtown, so we walked it back to the car anyway.  I was not going to let myself miss out on a second meal of that filet in the aftermath of Pittsburgh fireworks lol.

He said it would be in, in about 3 days. 5 days later I called, and he forgot to order it. 10 days later, I called them again, and they still forgot to order it, despite me being in front of the counter. \\\\nSecond situation was on Nov. 4 th, 2017. My 1998 Rav 4 was not carrying a charge despite me purchasing a new battery, the evening before. On that cold and snowy day, my wife and I broke down on 130th Ave S.E. . I managed to get the vehicle as far as the Safeway Parking lot, where we were stranded. I called the Canadian tire across the street and spoke to the manager. He told me to bring it right in. Well, we called a tow truck and waited for 2 and a half hours. No biggy there as it was a busy day for them as one could imagine. We brought the vehicle in on a large flat bead truck. I asked the mechanic, where did he want it; and he said anywhere. Once we dropped it; I went inside and spoke to Ron about the problems. Ron was a super nice guy. Very friendly. I mentioned to him, that there was a loose + positive cable clamp that had to be tightened. I needed to have the alternator checked as the new battery died on us . \\\\\"After the repairs are completed Ron, could you please have them do a safety check on the vehicle please?\\\\\" Here came the upsell. \\\\\" Well, he said, we have 3 different types of safety checks. Then he felt a pressing need to tell me all about them and their respective prices. I cut him off short, and instructed him to provide me with the cheapest (100.00) safety check. \\\\nHere in point form, were the blunders that were committed. \\\\n1. Ron got my name wrong, my sex wrong, and all this with me standing in front of him and correcting him as he put an entirely different name on the key tag. I corrected him and even called back to ensure that the information on the work order was complete; but he didn\\'t even bother to put down the much needed information. That\\'s just plain unprofessional. \\\\n2. I spoke to him about purchasing a new battery, just the night before, and that my + cable clamp was not tight. Despite this, he didn\\'t bother to put any of this on the work order. \\\\n3. Never informed me of the labor costs, part costs if it was a alternator and so forth\\\\n4.Never mentioned on the work order that the vehicle died while driving; but instead, said that it just stalled. \\\\n5. The assistant manager \\\\\" Dennis\\\\\" called and left a message for me, that the Rav would not pass a safety test because that battery is not working, and a headlight bulb was out. (Well of course....why do you think it was there?) \\\\n6. The assistant manager called me a second time at my residence later the next day; and informed me that my alternator would need replacing despite it being purchased new from one year previous. I asked him how much the alternator was and he gave me a rough cost. Then he said I would be charged. 1.2 ( which I guess was one hour and twenty minutes) for the labour. Fair enough I said, go ahead with the repair. At this point I figured;, it will be about 5 hundred dollars by the time they soak me for everything. \\\\n7. Later that day I picked up the vehicle and it was way over and above at $683.00. When asked to explain the costs...they said they were too busy. \\\\n8. When I arrived home, I looked at the invoice and noticed that they hadn\\'t even taken the time to fill out the top of the safety check. Truth be known, they never probably checked a thing. No name, no policy number, no make model or year of the vehicle, no Vin number, no date...absolutely nothing!\\\\n9. Shop supplies was 35 dollars and some change. There are only two bolts that secure an alternator to it\\'s bracket. Tell me where were there 35 worth there? \\\\n10. The assistant manager couldn\\'t provide me ( their customer) with the proper warrantee period for it, nor did he know how long safety checks are good for. \\\\n** Now after all that, does this sound like a professional service to you?

I was doubtful about spiced watermelon with chicken. (I mean watermelon on a main dish with chicken?!?). But once I had it, it totally made sense! The sweetness and juiciness of watermelon goes delightfully with the fried chicken; it kinda acts as a palette cleanser and takes away any feeling of greasiness. Totally yum! Honestly, I think I\\'d always try fried chicken with watermelon after this. Don\\'t be put off by this unusual combo! The spiced watermelon isn\\'t overly spiced. I tasted salt, pepper and cilantro.

       " 'text': \"I *adore* Travis at the Hard Rock's new Kelly Cardenas Salon!  I'm always a fan of a great blowout and no stranger to the chains that offer this service; however, Travis has taken the flawless blowout to a whole new level!  \\n\\nTravis's greets you with his perfectly green swoosh in his otherwise perfectly styled black hair and a Vegas-worthy rockstar outfit.  Next comes the most relaxing and incredible shampoo -- where you get a full head message that could cure even the very worst migraine in minutes --- and the scented shampoo room.  Travis has freakishly strong fingers (in a good way) and use the perfect amount of pressure.  That was superb!  Then starts the glorious blowout... where not one, not two, but THREE people were involved in doing the best round-brush action my hair has ever seen.  The team of stylists clearly gets along extremely well, as it's evident from the way they talk to and help one another that it's really genuine and not some corporate requirement.  It was so much fun to be there! \\n\\nNext Travis started with the flat iron.  The way he flipped his wrist to get volume all around without over-doing it and making me look like a Texas pagent girl was admirable.  It's also worth noting that he didn't fry my hair -- something that I've had happen before with less skilled stylists.  At the end of the blowout & style my hair was perfectly bouncey and looked terrific.  The only thing better?  That this awesome blowout lasted for days! \\n\\nTravis, I will see you every single time I'm out in Vegas.  You make me feel beauuuutiful!\",\n",
