This Yelp sentiment analysis project mainly focuses on two goals.

For goal 1, providing data-driven, actionable suggestions to Yelp business owners, we construct a Gradient Boosted Regression Trees to select business attributes with highest importance scores. Also a Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to select topics in reviews. Then propose suggestions from barplots and do hypothesis test for both business attributes and text contents.

For goal 2, a logistic regression model based on tfidf scores is used to predict the stars.

data folder contains a data url.txt, which contains one link to raw data and one link to cleaned data.
code folder contains our analysis on goal1 and our prediction model.
