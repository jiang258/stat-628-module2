This Yelp sentiment analysis project mainly focuses on two goals.

For goal 1, providing data-driven, actionable suggestions to Yelp business owners, we construct a Gradient Boosting Regression Trees to select business attributes with highest importance scores. Also a Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to select topics in reviews. Then propose suggestions from barplots and do hypothesis test for both business attributes and text contents.

For goal 2, a logistic regression model based on tfidf scores is used to predict the stars.
